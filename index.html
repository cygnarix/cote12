Operating Behind the Scenes
 
LET’S GO BACK IN TIME about two months, to a certain day in
February. In a meeting room in a certain facility somewhere in
Tokyo, a man who looked to be in his forties read information off
a screen as he explained something. A child was quietly listening
to him speak.
This child was fifteen years old. They would soon be
entering high school—and they were no mere child.
This child had been raised in a top-secret facility known as
the White Room and received a rather special education.
“That is all the detailed data we have on Ayanokouji
Kiyotaka and the other one hundred and fifty-six students in the
second year. Have you committed all of that to memory?” asked
Tsukishiro.
The screen in the room displayed all the data on its students
that the school had collected over the past year. Data that
included names, birth dates, and what schools they had
previously attended, of course, but also, parents and siblings,
their grades from early childhood, even their friendships. This was
a top-secret meeting. The kind of information being shared here
was the kind that even homeroom instructors wouldn’t normally
be able to access.
“I’m sure you’re already well aware of this, but the
important thing here is to get Ayanokouji-kun kicked out of school
and then bring him back to the White Room before the end of
April. We cannot afford to delay our plans any longer. However,
please be smart about how you execute this operation. You must
never make anything public. If the government does happen to
hear about our actions, then, his—sensei’s—name could be
dragged through the mud,” added Tsukishiro.
After hearing this explanation, the student from the White
Room slowly raised their hand. “In other words, don’t do anything
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_12">
<p>to attract unnecessary attention?”
“Precisely. Which is exactly why only someone like you, who
can pose as a student to infiltrate the school, can do this. I will
provide you with as much support as possible, but Sakayanagi will
likely be much more cautious from this point forward. You won’t
be able to do anything careless,” said Tsukishiro.
The student seemed to have gotten a grasp on the
situation, but their expression also seemed to contain a hint of
frustration. Tsukishiro did not miss that.
“The look on your face is telling me that you’re not exactly
happy about this,” said Tsukishiro.
After briefly glancing at Ayanokouji’s picture on the screen
behind him, he turned his gaze back to meet the child’s.
“I take it you know that he—that Ayanokouji-kun—is touted
as our facility’s magnum opus, our masterpiece? Not only was I
sent, but they’re even sending someone from the White Room.
Meaning they interrupted the experiments being conducted in the
White Room, which had finally resumed operations. I have to say,
it truly seems like an excessive and rather generous response.
I suppose that to someone who has been raised in the same
facility, there might be nothing more humiliating,” said Tsukishiro,
strongly emphasizing that last point as he continued his
explanation.
He was trying to get the student to show what they were
capable of by fanning the flames of their student competitive
spirit. Ayanokouji Kiyotaka is our masterpiece. Whenever the
students heard those words, some emotion lurking deep within
their hearts came bubbling up to the surface.
Tsukishiro had conducted himself flawlessly. But the one
thing he had misread was what that emotion was. Something
those who were raised in the White Room had drilled into them so
thoroughly that they grew to hate it.
“Become someone who can surpass Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.”
A feeling of intense hatred, which an unrelated third party
who hadn’t been raised in that facility could not understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_13">
<p>Sometimes, that feeling would swell to the point where it could no
longer be contained, and it would spark an outburst.
“The stage has been set. All I want you to do now is
demonstrate the full extent of your ability. Based on the data I’ve
looked at, I see no issues. If you have this level of ability, then it
shouldn’t take much effort at all for you to get him expelled, now,
should it?”
After Tsukishiro was done giving his explanation, as well as
a rather perverse form of provocation, he powered the screen off.
The room was engulfed in darkness for a moment but was filled
with light once more shortly afterward, as the ceiling lights came
on.
“Now, then. If there are no questions, let’s stop for the day.
Time is quite precious, after all,” said Tsukishiro.
The child, after hearing that, turned their back to Tsukishiro
and moved to leave the room as though nothing had happened.
He felt slightly bothered by their calm and collected behavior. His
instincts were telling him that he had misspoken earlier when he
was giving his explanation. However, he couldn’t take back any of
the words that he had already said.
“One more thing. There’s something I forgot to check,” said
Tsukishiro, calling out the child from behind, stopping them from
leaving the room. “You’re not hiding anything from me, are you?”
He was well aware that even though they were on the same
side, the organization wasn’t a monolith. If their ideas didn’t align
to start with, things wouldn’t work out so well. That was what he
was trying to confirm.
The student, without even looking back, just gave a small
nod and quietly continued walking away.
After the student had left the room, Tsukishiro turned the
lights down once more and brought the screen back up. Shown
on the screen was all the data about Ayanokouji Kiyotaka that had
been recorded in the White Room.
“I don’t like to use a word like this so casually, but… He
really is a monster,” said Tsukishiro.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_14">
<p>Needless to say, he had an elevated level of academic
ability. And on top of that, his physical abilities were so incredible
that he could put adults to shame. With his achievements and
record, even if he were put up against a professional fighter in a
no-holds barred fight, it would be over in an instant—with
Ayanokouji’s victory.
“A battle between two White Room students… If they had a
fair, direct competition, I wonder what the results would be?”
Of course, Tsukishiro had already devised a plan to ensure
that he would win. But even so, there were no absolute
guarantees.
“Hunt or be hunted, huh? This is a game between children,
but it seems like it could get interesting.”
Tsukishiro, an adult, wasn’t panicking. All he did was carry
out the task he had been given, methodically, without hurrying.</p>

True Ability
 
IT HAPPENED ONE YEAR, well into the twenty-first century.
While the rest of the world faced a variety of issues, Japan was,
similarly, at a turning point itself. A declining birthrate and an
aging population, environmental issues, decreasing political
power… Japanese society was in decline. To really get at the root
of these issues and fix them from the ground up, the government
began to put a great deal of effort into cultivating capable people.
This high school was created as part of that governmental
initiative. A center for learning that brought together students
from all over the country. A school that nurtured young people so
they would be ready to go out into the world.
The Advanced Nurturing High School.
One of the school’s most distinctive characteristics was that
its administrators did not ask applicants to submit the grades they
had received all the way up through junior high. Its students, who
were selected based on the school’s own unique set of criteria,
had a wide variety of distinct characteristics themselves, both
boys and girls. There were those who were capable when it came
to studying but lacked communication skills. There were those
who excelled in sports but struggled with academics. Some
students, meanwhile, seemed to have not a single redeeming
feature at all.
And yet, the school lumped all these students together so
that they might be granted an education. It was a system that
seemed entirely unthinkable for a normal high school. These
students, with their wide variety of unique personalities and
quirks, were made to go about their daily lives in groups and to
compete against each other, class against class. The purpose of
this was to give them the necessary foundation to do battle with a
competitive society, and to survive by cooperating with others.
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_16">
<p>And the fate that befell those students deemed unfit by the
school was expulsion. No mercy. You couldn’t survive at this
school if you were only good at studying or only good at sports.
Each grade level was divided up into four classes: A through D. At
the time of enrollment, there were roughly forty students
assigned to each given class, making for a total of one hundred
and sixty students.
Allow me to go into more detail about what makes this
school so wildly different from others. Let’s start with the basics.
Students are prohibited from contacting anyone outside the
school during the entirety of their three years here, until they
graduate. At the same time, students are forced to live in the
dormitories and prohibited from going outside campus.
That being said, the school boasts an impressively vast
campus equipped with a wide array of facilities for the students’
use. So it’s not like living on campus poses any issues. At Keyaki
Mall, a large commercial facility meant for the exclusive use of
students and school personnel, you can find almost anything and
everything you could possibly need. There’s a café, an electronics
retailer, a barber, a karaoke place, and more. In the unlikely event
that something isn’t available for sale there, students can
purchase it via the internet.
Furthermore, the money that students need to make
purchases as they go about their daily lives is given to them in the
form of something called “Private Points.” These points can be
used in place of real money, with an easy-to-understand
conversion. One point equals one yen.
However, it isn’t as though these Private Points are handed
out freely. They don’t grow on trees. Each month, students
receive a number of Private Points equal to one hundred times the
number of corresponding Class Points their class possesses. In
other words, to save up the requisite Private Points to go about
their daily lives, it is important for students to first secure Class
Points. There are several ways to go about increasing your
number of Class Points, but the standard method of doing so is to
complete a certain assignment given by the school—something
referred to as a “special exam.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_17">
<p>Basically, the four classes compete against one another in
these special exams, with the class placing first earning points,
and the class coming in at the bottom losing points. If a class had
one thousand points, that meant that the students of that class
would get a monthly stipend of one hundred thousand yen’s
worth of Private Points. Conversely, if a class continued to lose
and their Class Points tragically dwindled all the way down to
zero, students in that class would receive a total of zero Private
Points every month.
The wholly inextricable relationship between Class Points
and Private Points was most likely contrived by school officials in
order to make students with differing ways of thinking come
together. Having a decent number of Class Points meant you were
guaranteed to live a decently comfortable life as a student.
However, that isn’t the only appeal of the Advanced
Nurturing High School. The school’s greatest selling point is what
comes for those students who graduate from Class A.
The students who successfully manage to make it through
and graduate from Class A are able to go on to any place of
higher education or workplace of their choosing. Even in extreme
cases, like a university that boasts about how extremely difficult it
is to be accepted there, or a massive, prestigious company, a
student would be guaranteed to get in. A free pass.
That being said, it wasn’t as though students could afford to
be overly optimistic. It was clear that if a student didn’t have the
real ability to pass that barrier to entry on their own, they would
eventually get screened out and eliminated. Even so, there was
no doubt this was an extremely attractive perk.
Well, I suppose I’ve explained the gist of how things work
with the Advanced Nurturing High School.
I… Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, am currently enrolled in this rather
remarkable school as a student. And I will soon be entering my
second year here. As of April 1, I will be a student of Class D,
which has a total of two hundred and seventy-five Class Points,
meaning I would be receiving nearly thirty thousand yen’s worth
of Private Points every month.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_18">
<p>Sakayanagi is currently in first place. Class A, which she
leads, has an overwhelming one thousand one hundred and
nineteen points. Following behind them is Class B, led by
Ichinose, with five hundred and forty-two points. And slightly
behind them is Class C, led by Ryuuen, with five hundred and
forty points.
When you compared our class to the others, the difference
seems stark. But even so, you could say we’d narrowed the
distance between us. The amount that we could further close it
over this coming year would spell the difference between victory
and defeat.</p>

<p class="chapter">Chapter 3:</p>
A New Stage
 
AFTER SPRING BREAK, which somehow seemed both long and
short at the same time, had ended, the opening ceremony was
finally here. On that day, we moved from the first-year classroom
that we had grown so familiar with and into a new classroom for
second-year students. At first glance, the chairs and desks all
looked the same. But at the same time, they felt different,
somehow.
The first thing that we saw awaiting us when we arrived at
the classroom was a message written on the blackboard.
“Sit in the same seats you were assigned in your first year
and wait.”
Up until last year, what students referred to as a blackboard
was, well, something that teachers used chalk to write on.
However, the blackboard in front of us wasn’t really a blackboard
at all. A large monitor had replaced the blackboard, hanging on the
wall. Judging from the fact that it shone like it was brand new, I
was guessing monitors had only just been brought in this year.
The students who arrived at the classroom after me also
seemed quite surprised when they saw the new blackboard. I
decided to take my seat as instructed, heading toward the spot in
the far back of the room, near the window. Later in the day, the
opening ceremony would be held in the gymnasium. After that, the
homeroom instructors would spend about two hours going over
the schedule and the requirements for this year, and then we
would be dismissed later in the morning.
Since spring break had only just ended, some students still
seemed to be in a bit of a daze. Friends who hadn’t seen each
other for a while were talking animatedly about things like what
they were up to during the break. While I was randomly surfing
the internet on my phone looking for information, someone called
out to me.
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_20">
<p>“Hey.”
It was my classmate, Miyake Akito. He was one of the people
in the small group of friends that I had gotten close with.
“I was a little worried ’bout you, since you didn’t come to
hang out with the group all that much during the break,” said
Akito.
That was certainly true. I hadn’t really interacted at all with
the group during spring break. Or rather, I suppose, I should say
I’d been negligent because I had been so busy dealing with
various other issues.
“I mean, there’s no rule that says that we have to meet up or
anythin’ of course, but Haruka was pretty worried. And Airi
especially was concerned about you, it seemed like.” Akito was
basically advising me to be mindful of the feelings of the girls in
our group.
“Sorry. I’ll plan to hang out with you guys occasionally,” I
replied.
“That’d be good. I was feelin’ a little lonely without you
around myself,” said Akito.
I did feel a little bit uneasy, hearing that from a friend. But it
wasn’t a bad feeling. Akito gave me a light wave, as if to tell me he
wasn’t planning on hanging around my seat for long, and then
returned to his own desk.
I really felt like I had made some good friends. I mean, he
even went out of his way to give me some friendly advice.
After he had left, I didn’t feel like fiddling around with my
phone anymore, so I decided to listen in on what the other people
in class were saying. The topic of conversation had shifted from
what people did over spring break to the new students. Tomorrow
was the entrance ceremony, when new first-year students would
arrive.
Last year, we Class D students had gotten carried away by
the good treatment we received from the school at first and been
tripped up as a result. But that was understandable. We were
given one thousand Class Points immediately upon enrollment, the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_21">
<p>equivalent of one hundred thousand yen. Students were incredibly
excited by the large amount of money that they thought they’d be
receiving every month, and many went on buying sprees, getting
all kinds of things they wanted. Furthermore, tardiness and
absences were common, and many students had private
conversations or took naps in class.
The serious students, on the other hand, were focused only
on themselves, not on paying attention to what was going on
around them. I was sure there were many reasons for their lack of
attention to the others, but the school’s apparent neglect of the
problem children was probably the biggest one. After all, if the
teachers weren’t giving them any warnings, then the students
surely didn’t need to do so. Or so they thought.
But I supposed you could say that was just the first “special
exam” this school had for us. The school was testing us, to see if
we could realize that the education we were receiving here was
different from the compulsory education we received in elementary
school and junior high. And Class D had gotten the lowest possible
evaluation in that special exam. Quite spectacularly so.
In the following month, May, our Class Points had dropped to
zero. Meaning the number of points we received in our accounts
that month suddenly plummeted to a happy zero as well. After
that, Class D faced a series of trials and tribulations throughout the
year. But after our class had hit rock bottom, our scattered,
disparate classmates slowly started to mature, and the class
became more unified. At one point, we even managed to make it
up to Class C. But unfortunately, because of what happened at the
year-end final exam, we were demoted back down to Class D.
However, our class had managed to regain two hundred and
seventy-five Class Points by the end of the year. While there was
still a huge gap between us and Class A, the most important
aspect of our attempt to reach for the top was just how many
Class Points we could gain over this next year, our second at this
school.
“Good morning!” said a rather energetic girl, her voice
carrying across the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_22">
<p>The girls in the classroom reacted as soon as those words
were said. They gathered around the speaker, who was the leader
of the girls in our class, Karuizawa Kei. The number of girls around
her kept increasing. Before I knew it, they’d resumed the same
conversations they’d just been having
Also, it was just the other day that I had started dating Kei,
our class’s queen bee. The only person who knew that fact right
now, aside from me, was Kei herself.
As I reminisced, while listening to the conversations around
me, a surprised shout—no, more of a shriek—reverberated
throughout the classroom. When I looked up to see what was
happening, I immediately realized what the shock and awe was all
about. You could say it was an exceedingly natural reaction to
have upon seeing what the girl who had just quietly arrived at
school looked like.
The girl, despite attracting the attention of everyone around
her, didn’t react at all to everyone’s surprise. Instead, she went to
take her seat, right next to mine. Her formerly long, beautiful black
hair was gone. It was now rather short, not even shoulder length.
She had reconciled with her older brother, Horikita Manabu,
and decided to say goodbye to her past self, cutting her hair to
reflect that decision. It was precisely because I knew that that I
wasn’t surprised right now, but I supposed that if this were my
first time seeing her like this, I would probably have reacted
similarly to those around me.
“S-Suzune…? You, your hair… What happened to your hair?!”
shouted Sudou Ken, flustered. He abandoned the conversation
he’d been having with his friend and ran over toward Horikita.
Sudou was one of our classmates, and he was also in love with
Horikita.
One other person, a girl, seemed perplexed by Horikita’s
transformation and approached her in a similar fashion. “Horikita-
san, you’ve…had a complete makeover. I’m so surprised!” she said.
Kushida Kikyou. Another of our classmates, and someone
who had attended the same junior high as Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_23">
<p>“Is it really so strange that I cut my hair?” Horikita shot
glances not only at Sudou, but at the many other students who
were staring at her.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_24">
<img src="https://cote12.ct.ws/10.jpg">
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_25">
<p>“W-well, no, it’s not like, strange or anythin’, it’s just
surprisin’ is all… It’s like, with this hairstyle, you’ve got a
completely different look and all… Well, um, it’s not like I’m saying
it doesn’t work for you or anything! I think you look good with
short hair, too. D-don’t you think so too, Kushida?” said Sudou.
While the sudden change in her appearance certainly had
quite the impact, from Sudou’s point of view, things like the length
of her hair were trivial. If anything, he welcomed his crush’s new
look with open arms, showing that he was quite happy about it.
However, Kushida couldn’t really hide her discomfort when Sudou
suddenly put her on the spot, asking for her to agree.
“Yeah, I suppose. Yeah. I think it looks good on her. But…
Did something happen?” She must not have wanted to explain
what she thought in detail, because she shifted the topic of
conversation to asking about the reason Horikita had cut her hair.
“Wait, whaddya mean, did something happen? Like what?”
asked Sudou, jumping at Kushida’s question before Horikita could
respond herself.
“Well, for example… maybe she had her heart broken, or
something,” said Kushida.
“B-B-B-B-broken?!” stammered Sudou.
“If I had to say anything, it’s an expression of my
determination,” replied Horikita, without skipping a beat, as if
trying to banish the words heart and broken from the air.
“O-okay, I see. Yeah, there’s no way you’d have your heart
broken or something, right?” said Sudou.
Despite saying that, he seemed like he was breaking out in a
cold sweat.
“Now that we’re second-year students, I’m going to fight to
make sure Class D rises to the top. And I want to do what I can to
make that happen,” said Horikita.
“I see, okay. Well, in that case… Maybe I’ll try the opposite,
grow my hair out,” said Kushida.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_26">
<p>She made it sound cutesy, but the words somehow also
conveyed how she really felt, deep down. She was upset that her
hair was the same length as the person she hated. I didn’t think
anyone would assume she was being serious about growing her
hair out long, but she might actually do just that. I couldn’t help
but imagine the raging emotions hidden inside what she’d just
said.
“If you’re satisfied, could you both return to your own
seats?” snapped Horikita.
She clearly didn’t want people to stand around and gawk at
her this much, whether her hair was long or short. Though
Horikita’s new look had certainly had a significant impact on the
people around her, she seemed to be rather unhappy with the
attention it was getting her. She looked like she was in a bad mood
now, but fortunately enough, the bell rang soon afterward,
bringing the chatter to an abrupt end.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_27">
<p>3.1
 
SEVERAL DAYS HAD PASSED already since the opening ceremony
ended. The weekend came and went, and it was now Monday. A
peaceful life here at school. A regular routine that repeated itself
over and over. The most momentous change at the start of this
new year was that the blackboards were now digital and all our
textbooks had been replaced with tablets. Last week, we’d looked
down at our hands, which held the new tablet devices that had
just been handed out to us.
The fact that the textbooks we were using had all been
replaced by tablets illustrated just how remarkable the spread of e-
books was. Each student was given their own tablet, and newly
installed high-speed charging devices were in the back of the
classrooms. We were also provided with portable battery packs as
well, in the unlikely event that our tablets died in the middle of
class. We were forbidden to bring the tablets themselves back to
the dorms, but we were allowed to transfer any data we needed
over the school’s network, to access it from our rooms.
The annoyingly high number of textbooks we needed to lug
around were now all stored neatly inside this twelve-inch tablet, as
data. Not only did this mean we could freely work with graphics
and photos, but the tablets were also an effective response to
globalization, allowing us to openly communicate back and forth
with people from other countries, such as in English class.
Considering that this school was overseen by the government, it
seemed they were lagging somewhat behind in implementing
these changes.
However, it remained unclear for now whether or not these
changes were necessarily the correct decision. I supposed we’d
understand their impact better after seeing how these children
grew, and how they integrated into society in the future.
The scope of our studies as second-year students would be
more difficult than in our first year, of course. I didn’t know exactly
how this school compared to other high schools in that regard, but</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_28">
<p>it was safe to assume it was above average, at the very least. I
wondered how much students like Sudou and Ike would be able to
keep up with their studies on their own. If we wanted to make
sure not a single student got expelled, it might be more essential
than ever for us to support each other.
At any rate, while the biggest change came in the form of
the digitization of our study materials, there were a number of
other things to note. If I had to mention one, it would be the
ability to change seats, by way of using your Private Points to
secure the spot that you want.
I moved from my old spot near the window toward a seat on
the opposite side of the classroom, in the back by the hallway.
Apparently, the seats near the hallway were generally unpopular
because of all the people coming and coming, but it didn’t really
bother me all that much. Also, while I’d been occasionally passing
new students more and more often of late, I obviously still hadn’t
actually talked to any of them yet, not being involved in any club
activities. As a result, nothing about my personal situation had
really changed.
I supposed that wasn’t so strange, considering that when I
was a first-year, the first time I actually had a proper conversation
with a senior student was for a special exam, since that student
had access to old test materials. At any rate, the first few days of
the new school year had been quiet.
“Is everyone present?” asked our homeroom instructor
Chabashira, striding into the classroom at almost the exact
moment the bell rang.
As our morning homeroom began, she stood at the teacher’s
podium with a serious expression on her face. That, coupled with
the fact that we didn’t have any classes for first and second period
today, made me predict something was going to happen.
Apparently, this brief moment of peace was about to come to an
end.
“Sensei, is there a special exam?” asked Ike, before our
homeroom instructor made her announcement.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_29">
<p>It sounded like he was asking out of a sense of eager
restlessness, rather than because he was messing around. And
Chabashira understood that, which was why she didn’t seem to
object to him asking. In the past, every time a special exam was
announced, most of the students understandably felt anxious. But
now those special exams were unavoidable obstacles we had to
overcome on our path to the top. And our class was getting ready
to face those challenges.
“I’m sure you’re worried about that, but before we get into
that discussion, there’s something I’d like for you to do. Something
that will be particularly important to how you lead your lives here
at this school in the future,” said Chabashira.
She took out her cell phone, continuing to speak while
showing it to us.
“Please take out your phones and place them on your desk,
everyone. If anyone has forgotten their phone, I ask that you go
and retrieve it immediately… But it seems as though no one has
forgotten their phone,” said Chabashira.
Cell phones were essential everyday items. You might even
say they were the most important objects of all, being something
you kept on you at all times.
Before long, Chabashira had verified that thirty-nine phones
had been placed out on the desks. She resumed speaking once
more.
“First, I’d like you all to go to the school’s official website and
install a new application. It should be available for download at
this time. Though the official name for the app is ‘Overall Ability,’ it
will just show up as ‘OAA’ on your phone after you’ve installed it,”
explained Chabashira.
A live-action demonstration video with text captions popped
up on the blackboard screen and started to play. I supposed this
was one of the conveniences now afforded to us, thanks to the
digitization of our classroom. After following along with what
Chabashira told us and what the instructions on the screen
showed, I installed the app on my phone. It created an icon that</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_30">
<p>had both the acronym “OAA” on it as well as what looked like an
illustration of the school.
“After you’ve finished installing the app, please put down
your phones. Please raise your hand if there’s something you’re
having trouble understanding.”
The process was quite simple. Everyone was used to
handling a phone, so no one struggled with this, and things
proceeded smoothly.
“You Class D students aren’t the only ones being asked to
install this app. Right now, everyone in school, across every grade
level, is being asked to do so. This app is truly remarkable. It will
certainly benefit the students of the Advanced Nurturing High
School in a multitude of ways in the days to come. But ‘seeing is
believing,’ as they say, so please boot up the app,” said
Chabashira.
I tapped the icon and launched the app. When I did so, my
phone’s camera automatically came on.
“By scanning your student ID with your camera, the initial
setup will be completed automatically,” explained Chabashira.
Following her instructions, I held my student ID card out in
front of the camera. It scanned the information on it, like my
profile photo and student ID number, then continued the login
process.
“Now, you should all have successfully created your own
individual accounts. Moving forward, you won’t need to log in
anymore. But because your account is tied to your phone, we do
ask that you take extra care not to lose it.”
After finishing the login process, several different options
were displayed.
“This app holds personal data for the entire school. For
example, if you select Second-Year Class D, your names will be
displayed, in standard order. Try it out,” said Chabashira.
Sure enough, profile pictures and full names for all thirty-nine
students were displayed, in order.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_31">
<p>“You are free to look at any profile, but it would probably be
a good idea for you to tap on your own name first,” said
Chabashira.
I tapped on my name, just as she had suggested. I had
expected that I’d see only basic information like my date of birth,
but that didn’t seem to be the case. What was displayed were
items and number values that I haven’t ever seen before.
 
2 – D Ayanokouji Kiyotaka
First Year Results
Academic Ability: C (51)
Physical Ability: C+ (60)
Adaptability: D+ (37)
Societal Contribution: C+ (60)
Overall Ability: C (51)
 
“S-Sensei, uh, my results look like they’ve kind of turned
into, like, stats in a video game or something!” shouted Ike.
“That’s right. These are your own individual performance
scores, calculated by the school based on your achievements
through the end of your first year here. You aren’t the only class
who is able to access this information. It’s possible for students to
view performance scores for students in other classes as well. In
fact, any student in any grade level can do so. This system was
adopted because it was deemed to be important for the future of
your education,” said Chabashira.
In other words, the app’s purpose was to provide an
overview of everyone’s individual performance scores, represented
as numerical data. It also seemed like it could be used to send
public messages to all students.
There was a question mark in the upper-right part of the
screen, along with the word “Description.” When I pressed it,
detailed information about each item was displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_32">
<p>Academic Ability: Calculated mainly based on scores on
written exams, etc., given throughout the year
Physical Ability: Calculated based on evaluations from
physical education classes, activity in clubs, and evaluations from
special exams, etc.
Adaptability: Calculated based on your ability to adapt to
society around you. This includes things such as how many friends
you have, your position in your social circle and your
communication skills, whether you can think on your feet, etc.
Societal Contribution: Calculated based on a variety of
factors, such as your attitude in class, including any lateness or
absences on your record, whether you’ve exhibited any
problematic behavior, contributions made to the school via
membership on the student council, etc.
Overall Ability: Student’s overall abilities are derived from
the four values above. However, the effect that the Social
Contribution score has on this calculation is reduced by half.
*Note: Method for calculating overall ability
(Academic Ability + Physical Ability + Adaptability + Social
Contribution x 0.5) ÷ 350 x 100 (Rounded up to the nearest whole
number)
 
I see. Based on the criteria, it made sense that my
adaptability score would be lower than the others. And when it
came to the number of friends I had and my communication skills,
well, I wasn’t exactly flourishing there. If the other scores were
evaluated based on what they typically saw from me, those
numbers seemed reasonable, too. There were also fields for my
scores for my second- and third-year evaluations in addition to my
first year, but those were currently blank.
“Right now, only the scores for your first year are displayed.
But now that you’ve begun your second year, your new evaluations
will be given to you as they are assessed by the school, the scores
being updated as time goes on. Scores will be updated at the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_33">
<p>beginning of the month, just like with Class Points. For example,
Sudou, your current academic ability score is E. However, if you
happened to get a perfect score on the next written exam, you
would be given an A+ on your second-year evaluations page,” said
Chabashira.
Which meant our second-year evaluations would be separate
from the first-year evaluations. Our scores for this year would be
evaluated based only on the events of this year. This also meant
our scores over the course of the year were constantly being
recorded. Even if Sudou got a perfect score in a written exam in
April and got an A+ for his academic ability score, if he got a zero
on the next written exam after that, he’d end up with a C rating.
That was how things would be over the course of the year.
And then, our final average scores would be calculated at the end
of the year. One of the things worth noting about this app was that
we weren’t just able to check scores for our own class, but could
look up the other classes, too. Up until this point, I couldn’t know
anything about students I’d never interacted with unless I directly
went out and gathered that information. But now, with only a
glance, I could see names, faces, and what kind of scores
someone had, regardless of what grade level they were in.
Incidentally, the data for the new first-year students seemed
to be based on information from their third year of junior high and
from their entrance exams. So, academic ability, physical ability,
and societal contribution rankings aside, it was possible their
current adaptability scores might not be all that accurate.
A handy tool for checking grades… Well, no. There was no
way that was all there was to it. It was obvious this was going to
play some kind of key role.
“I’m sure that the students who got rather unsatisfactory
results aren’t thrilled about the idea of having their records
retained like this. However, those students simply need to come to
terms with the fact that they were the ones who spent their first
year that way,” explained Chabashira.
Basically, the closer your precious academic and physical
ability scores were to E, the more disgraced you would be.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_34">
<p>“However, your first-year scores are nothing more than a
past record. They will have no effect whatsoever on how you are
assessed in the future, as second-year students. Which means it’s
especially important that those of you who got disappointing
results in your first year take this opportunity to reevaluate your
priorities. By visualizing your scores this way, we’re hoping you’ll
be encouraged to grow into your best selves,” she added.
I supposed that if our individual scores were going to be
continuously recorded in an app that anyone could see from this
point onward, many students would want to make an effort to
make themselves look better. I was sure that would be effective to
a certain degree when it came to prompting students to get their
grades up, as Chabashira had said, but…
“Sensei, why is the evaluation metric for societal contribution
a little bit different from the other three items, though?” asked
Hirata Yousuke.
The effect of our societal contribution score on our overall
ability score was half as much as the others. Hirata had his
concerns about that, which was why he asked that question.
“Academic ability, physical ability, and adaptability. The
school considers those three categories to be extremely important.
Societal contribution, on the other hand, is a little different,” said
Chabashira. “It is fundamentally based on ‘morals’ and ‘manners.’
It’s an assessment of how you conduct yourselves as students,
examined from every possible angle. Things like how influential
your voice is in a group, or how often you’re correct. Things like
how you talk to and behave in front of your teachers, and whether
you have any tardy arrivals or absences on your record. Whether
or not you comply with various rules. Because these are basic skills
and common courtesies you should naturally be striving toward
anyway, their impact on your overall ability score is reduced.”
So unlike the other three categories, which you couldn’t
dramatically improve overnight, we could greatly improve our
societal contribution scores if we changed our attitudes from this
day onward. That was the difference.
“This app is impartial. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a higher
or lower-level class. Everyone is assessed similarly. Right now, if a</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_35">
<p>student has a high overall ability evaluation, it’s safe to assume
that person has successfully achieved something worthy of praise.”
The list was arranged in order by name, but there was a
‘sort’ feature, too. So I didn’t need to look at each student one by
one to know who had the highest overall ability scores in Class 2-
D. After trying out the sort function, I saw Yousuke had the top
score.
 
2-D Hirata Yousuke
First Year Results
Academic Ability: B+ (76)
Physical Ability: B+ (79)
Adaptability: B (75)
Societal Contribution: A- (85)
Overall Ability: B+ (78)
 
You could understand Yousuke’s excellence with just one
glance at his scores. These scores were nothing to scoff at. He was
above average in every area. If he hadn’t openly exposed the
weakness in his heart towards the end of our first year, his scores
might have even been a little higher.
On the other hand, after choosing to sort students in
descending order of overall ability, I saw Ike held the number one
spot. His overall ability score was 37. He was actually tied with
Sakura Airi, who also had an overall ability score of 37.
Sudou, who was considered by many to be the most likely
candidate for the lowest score, actually appeared to have scored
better than several students.
 
2-D Sudou Ken
First Year Results
Academic Ability: E+ (20)</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_36">
<p>Physical Ability: A+ (96)
Adaptability: D+ (40)
Societal Contribution: E+ (19)
Overall Ability: C (47)
 
His academic ability and societal contribution scores were
quite low, thanks in part to his unruly behavior in the first year.
However, his high physical ability assessment was enough to
compensate for that, letting him avoid being the worst-ranked
student. I did a little digging in the app and found he was the only
student in our grade level that had gotten an A+ assessment in
the physical ability category.
Sudou’s academic ability had improved since he had started
school here, and he’d also been demonstrating mental and
emotional growth. It seemed likely his scores would greatly
improve from this year onward.
“Also, though this has nothing directly to do with Class D, a
certain exception has been made for someone in your grade level.
Sakayanagi Arisu, from Class 2-A, will have her physical ability
score set at the same value as the student with the lowest score in
the grade level,” explained Chabashira.
Sakayanagi Arisu had a physical disability that required her to
use a cane to walk around normally. Meaning, even if she wanted
to exercise, it wasn’t something she could really do. I supposed it
wasn’t like they could entirely omit her physical ability score and
still calculate her overall score, so it was a reasonable decision to
place her at the bottom of the rankings.
At any rate, this tool for visualizing abilities might be
considered essential to implementing the true meritocracy Nagumo
had been advocating for.
“I’m sure this app will serve as a valuable tool, not just in
getting you to change the way you see your grades, but also by
getting you to interact with your fellow students, since you’ll be
able to familiarize yourself with their names and faces regardless
of grade level. However… Well, in my opinion, that’s not all. This is</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_37">
<p>just my personal speculation, but… I’m thinking students who fail
to keep their overall ability score above a certain level may be hit
with a certain penalty, or something to that effect,” said
Chabashira.
“Penalty… Wait, you couldn’t mean expulsion, do you…?”
“That is a possibility. But, as I just said, that’s just my
personal speculation. It may not be true. Still, I think it’s fair to
assume that the closer your overall ability score is to E, the greater
the risks you face,” said Chabashira.
At this current point in time, Ike and Airi had the worst
scores in class, with an overall ability score close to E. If they
spent this year like they had the last one, they’d be in imminent
danger.
“I’m sure some of you might have issues with how the school
has evaluated you vs. how you have evaluated yourself. However,
this is just the school’s current evaluation of you. If you’re unhappy
about it, then show them what you’ve got. Do your best this year
to convince the school to change their minds about you.
Remember, the school isn’t all-knowing and omnipotent or
anything,” said Chabashira.
“B-But how are we supposed to show them, sensei?!” wailed
Ike, raising his hand in a panic after having confirmed that he was
indeed ranked at the bottom.
“Well, here’s one way. There is admittedly a difference in
accuracy when it comes to evaluating the physical abilities of a
student who does participate in club activities vs. a student who
does not. If you’re feeling confident in yourself, try joining a club,”
said Chabashira.
She was saying that students who directly demonstrated
what they could do to the school were more likely to be given
more favorable treatment. However, students were still evaluated
on a case-by-case basis. If one of them tried to show off too
much, or too carelessly, it could lead to problems.
“It’s almost like we’re each fighting individual battles,”
muttered Horikita, under her breath.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_38">
<p>Chabashira didn’t miss what Horikita said. It seemed like the
introduction of this app completely negated the kind of battles
we’d been fighting so far—together, as a class. I was sure Horikita
wasn’t the only one who felt that way.
“Well, that’s both incorrect and correct. This system, which is
to be introduced starting this year, was proposed by the current
student council president, Nagumo Miyabi. School administrators
approved and adopted it,” said Chabashira.
So Nagumo’s dream of creating a system where individuals
were assessed on their own merits had been realized. I was
guessing the reason he didn’t make that many moves last year
was because it took quite a bit of time and effort to get this app
off the ground.
“But the fundamental concept remains unchanged. The
school is expecting you to work together as a class, just as you’ve
done so far. Please don’t forget that point, and continue to do your
best, day after day,” said Chabashira.
After we finished installing the app and Chabashira finished
giving us her explanation, our first period was to an end. Now that
we had recess, students began to stare at their phones, noses
glued to their screens. I was sure they wanted to see their own
scores, as well as the scores of their classmates and students from
the other classes.
“Well, I really don’t like that they’re treatin’ me like I have
less common sense than Kouenji, of all people!” shouted Sudou
after looking intently through the app, glaring at Kouenji as he did.
After I heard him say that, I decided to check for myself,
while still keeping my ears open (though he was speaking so
loudly that I could overhear pretty easily anyway).
 
2-D Kouenji Rokusuke
First Year Results
Academic Ability: B (71)
Physical Ability: B+ (78)</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_39">
<p>Adaptability: D- (24)
Societal Contribution: D- (25)
Overall Ability: C (53)
 
Given the fact that Kouenji had demonstrated a fair amount
of proficiency regularly during class and on tests, he had scored
highly in both academic ability and physical ability.
“What? Come on, dude, it’s like, whatever, right? ’Sides,
you’re wayyyy better than he is when it comes to physical ability,
man,” Ike grumbled, his jealousy clear in his voice, since he didn’t
excel in any particular area.
“That’s prolly only ’cause Kouenji doesn’t take anything
seriously. Though I hate to admit it,” said Sudou.
Just as Sudou had suggested, Kouenji’s physical abilities
were exceptionally high. Off the charts even. He had potential
equal to or greater than Sudou’s, but he wasn’t involved with any
clubs and his participation in things like physical education class
was wildly irregular, since it depended largely on his mood. If he
wasn’t personally interested in something, he would skip it without
a moment’s hesitation, or might even suddenly abandon it. It also
wasn’t all that uncommon for him to just not lift a finger in the first
place.
In contrast, Sudou always took things seriously, no matter
the task. The results he achieved in that arena had put him at the
top of the class. It was no wonder there was a huge gap in their
assessments, even though they had similar physical ability.
The part that Sudou got tripped up on was societal
contribution. In other words, the category that was all about
manners and morals. In that regard, Kouenji, who was being
singled out by Sudou right now, was just as much a problem child
as Sudou. It seemed Sudou was really unhappy with the fact that
he’d scored lower than Kouenji, even though it was only by a small
margin.
It wasn’t like I didn’t understand why he might want to
complain, but… I was guessing the reason Kouenji had scored</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_40">
<p>higher than Sudou in societal contribution was because he hadn’t
had as many opportunities to act to the detriment of the class or
the school in general. It was no surprise that Sudou, given his
suspension and violent outbursts and such, had scored lower.
Even though Kouenji had heard everything Sudou was
saying, he acted as though it had nothing to do with him. He
hadn’t even bothered looking at the OAA app more than what was
strictly necessary, while everyone else seemed totally engrossed by
it.
I supposed that after spending more than a year here at this
school, the thing that had changed the least was probably Kouenji.
Anyway, we could now visualize what our grades were like
for our first year. This move by the school—the introduction of this
app—presented both advantages and disadvantages. For example,
the existence of an overall ability category now provided a
provisional ranking for the students in class. If a rather
inconvenient special exam took place now, it wouldn’t be
necessary to answer the question of who should step forward as a
candidate for possible expulsion. The students with low overall
ability scores would be the ones we’d focus on.
Ike—and Airi, since she was tied with him at dead last in the
rankings—had to be very anxious right now. Like they were on pins
and needles.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_41">
<p>3.2
 
SECOND PERIOD BEGAN, the topic of the OAA app still lingering
in the back of our minds. We were probably about to get to the
other topic at hand. Receiving a full explanation about that other
thing. Or so the students were thinking—and that prediction was
quickly proved correct.
“And now, I’ll provide an overview of the next special exam,”
said Chabashira, immediately launching into the topic as if she
were starting a normal lesson. “This is your first special exam as
second-year students, and it’s going to involve some
unprecedented new ventures, the likes of which have never been
seen before. Such as the introduction of this app.”
Was that Tsukishiro’s influence? Or was it Nagumo’s? At any
rate, it seemed the school system was also undergoing some
major changes.
“The crucial thing for you to know is that this will be a
written test in which you second-year students will be partnered
up with the new arrivals, the first-year students,” said Chabashira.
“Partnered up with… first-year students…?”
Up until this point, we’d hardly done anything that cut across
the boundaries between grade levels. There were some
exceptions, like the school camp, but that had still been part of the
normal framework of inter-class competition. Had those walls been
taken down with the introduction of OAA, then?
“In this special exam, you’ll be mainly assessed on your
written test-taking skills and your communications skills,” said
Chabashira.
Our academic and communication skills. At first glance, the
two things didn’t seem to go together.
“The importance of this written text really needs no further
explanation. But until now, the school has never had such in-depth
interactions between students of different grade levels, except for
things like the sports festival and the school camp. Which is</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_42">
<p>precisely why the school has determined that its students’
communication skills were not as well-developed as they could be,”
said Chabashira.
“B-But, we’re still competing against other classes in our
grade, right? I dunno, it’s just like, something about this feels off,”
said Ike, who looked a little unhappy about the fact that the first-
year students were going to be heavily involved.
“I understand how you feel, but try thinking about it
objectively. When you first go out into the world and join society at
large, the people you encounter won’t just be new, fresh-faced
graduates like you. Some might be in their second year in the
workforce. You’ll even be competing with veterans who’ve been
out in the world for twenty or thirty years. People much older or
younger than you could come to be your rivals,” said Chabashira.
“That’s… Well, yeah, I guess I can picture that.”
“While other parts of the world are embracing meritocracy,
many Japanese companies continue to be bound by systems of
seniority and permanent lifetime employment. If you think it feels
strange to interact with students older or younger than you, you
should really change your perspective. To put it in terms that might
be easier for you to understand, there’s a concept called ‘skipping
grades’ that’s a widespread practice in places like the United
States, England, and Germany. It’s not unusual for small children
to study together with high school or even college students. Can
you imagine and accept the idea of elementary school students
here in this classroom, learning with you, in the same fashion?”
My classmates let their imaginations run wild, just as
Chabashira had prompted them to do. And I was sure they still
couldn’t understand it. It must have felt impossible or strange to
them, and it was certainly true that skipping grades was rarely
done in Japan. In fact, while there were certain conditions that had
to be met in order for someone to skip grades, I was sure many
people didn’t even know that it was possible to do so.
The idea of skipping grades didn’t really fit with the current
status-quo in Japan, where learning was treated as something that
you did in an equal or egalitarian manner, along a set, linear path.
And so, the system wasn’t entirely accepted here. Personally, I had</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_43">
<p>no resistance to the idea. There was no such linear learning style
in the White Room.
However, I was also certain what Chabashira was saying
right now wasn’t everything. Imitating what other countries were
doing wasn’t sufficient; Japan needed to have an educational
system that fit Japan’s social climate. Chabashira probably knew
this, too, but I was guessing she had no choice but to explain
things to us in accordance with the orders she had received from
higher up.
“There will probably be cases in the future where you’ll be
competing against first-year and third-year students. But this time,
you’ll be cooperating with one another. Please keep that in mind,”
said Chabashira.
Was that why we were having this special exam that required
both written test-taking skills and communication skills? Some
students were cocking their heads to the side in apparent
confusion, perhaps because they were unable to imagine what the
rules would be like.
“The best way to understand how this will work is for you to
think back to one of your special exams from last year. It’s
probably easier for you to wrap your heads around this test if you
think of it as an improved, modified version of the Paper Shuffle
exam, where you had to find a partner from among your
classmates,” said Chabashira.
The Paper Shuffle had been a special exam where we had to
form pairs with a classmate and then handle taking a test together.
Essentially, we wouldn’t be partnering with someone from our own
class this time, but rather with first-year students, from the sounds
of it. Even though that seemed like the only difference, it was a
huge one.
“You are free to decide which of the first-years you want to
partner up with, from any class. The partner selection period is
about two weeks, starting today and lasting until the end of the
month. You’ll have time both to carefully select your partners and
devote yourselves to your studies,” said Chabashira.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_44">
<p>With how this special exam worked, it was no wonder we
were being made to install the OAA app at this stage. The first-
year students obviously wouldn’t be familiar with the names and
faces of their seniors, and the second-year students wouldn’t be
familiar with the names and faces of first-years. In the Paper
Shuffle, where we’d picked partners from among our classmates,
we were able to do so freely, with nuance and coordination,
precisely because we were choosing from among people we knew
well. This made it easy for a student who was poor at academics
to make it through with someone else’s support.
This exam, however, was different. It operated on the
premise that both students would be looking for an excellent
partner. Moreover, instead of partnering up with students in our
grade level, we’d be partnering with first-years, who we had no
relationship with. The first-years and second-years were each
working with their own unique set of circumstances, too. We each
had our own things to deal with.
More importantly, it took a considerable amount of time to
build a relationship of trust from nothing. If we wanted to build
such a relationship without this app, then two weeks would most
certainly not be enough. With the OAA app, however, we could
take some shortcuts by being able to recognize names and faces
based on what we saw in the app. Moreover, since we could get a
rough sense of everyone’s current academic ability, it would be
easy for us to use it as reference when looking for partners.
“On the day of the written test, you will be tested on five
subjects. Each subject is worth one hundred points, for a total of
five hundred points. And the most important rule is… Well, this
time, there are two areas in which you’ll be competing. As a class
and as individuals,” said Chabashira.
She held her finger up to the blackboard, bringing up the
display for the results of the special exam.
 
Class Rewards For Each Grade Level
The winning class will be determined based on each class’s
average score, which will be derived from the scores of all</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_45">
<p>members of the class and the scores of all their partners. The
Class Point rewards are fifty points, thirty points, ten points, and
zero points, in descending order of average score.
Individual Rewards
Winners are determined based on the combined scores of
each pair of partners. The top five pairs will receive 100,000
Private Points each as a special reward. Pairs who score in the top
thirtieth percentile will each receive 10,000 points. In the event
that a pair has a total score of 500 points or less, the second-year
student will be expelled, and the first-year student will not receive
any Private Points for a period of three months, regardless of how
many Class Points their class has.
In addition, any student determined to have manipulated
their scores, such as by purposefully answering questions
incorrectly, will be expelled, regardless of their grade level.
Similarly, in the event that a third party is found to have forced
another student to lower their score, that third party will be
expelled.
 
“I’m sure you already have an inkling of this, but in this
exam, students with excellent academic ability will be highly
sought after,” said Chabashira.
If we didn’t have the OAA app, we wouldn’t have been able
to see those kinds of details. But with the release of this app,
students’ abilities were now on full display for everyone to see. The
worse a students’ academic ability score, the harder it would be for
that student to find a partner. It was clear that the students who
had concerns about their grades were likely to be left behind.
Smart students would, naturally, try to team up with smart
partners and aim for the top rewards. Students who struggled with
their grades would similarly seek smart partners in order to
survive. If two poor students, of which there were many, ended up
teaming up, they might very well score under the five-hundred-
point mark. If that happened, the second-year student would face
the harsh reality of expulsion.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_46">
<p>Second-year students understood how this school worked
and had developed more than a few friendships within their
classes. They would probably try to help their classmates, even if it
meant giving up on the higher-level rewards. The first-year
students, however, would naturally struggle to unite their classes
for now. As a result, they wouldn’t give all that much thought to
the fact that a student they didn’t know very well, whom they
weren’t really friends with, would have to go three months without
getting any Private Points. It wouldn’t seem like all that big a deal
to them.
It would be just like that time a year ago, when almost
everyone in our class was thinking about abandoning Sudou… No,
actually, it would be even worse than that.
“Partnerships are established based on mutual acceptance
from both participants, and they are finalized via registration in the
OAA app. It will be possible for you to select a partner from this
moment onward, but keep in mind that once your partner has
given their consent and the match has been confirmed, you will
not be allowed to dissolve the partnership afterward for any
reason,” explained Chabashira.
That made it all the harder to choose quickly, unless the
other person’s academic ability was especially high. A hasty
decision could lead to regret down the line.
The monitor refreshed, then displayed information related to
partnerships.
 
Methods and Rules for Determining a Partner
Students are allowed to send a partner request per day to
the person they wish to partner with, using the OAA app. If the
partner request is not accepted by the other party, your ability to
send a fresh request will be reset at 24:00.
If the other party does accept your partner request, the
partnership will be confirmed, and you will not be allowed to
cancel the partnership afterward.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_47">
<p>*Note: The only exception to this rule is certain extenuating
circumstances, such as if the other student has been expelled or is
seriously ill.
Once a partnership has been confirmed, the OAA app will be
updated at 8:00 a.m. on the following day, and both students will
not be able to accept any new partner requests.
*Note: The names of who students have partnered up with
will not be shown in the app.
 
With these rules in place, you couldn’t just send out a large
number of partner requests at random. And even if you did send a
request to a specific person, that request might end up going to
waste, because that person might already have partnered with
someone else that day and you wouldn’t know until the app
updated at 8:00 a.m the following day.
I didn’t know if a student would really accept a partner
request from someone they didn’t know too well, though. Most
likely, these rules were put in place as a measure to make it
impossible to know who had teamed up with who. It would make it
too easy to estimate the strength of each class if the details of the
partnerships were shown right from the start, I supposed.
“Sensei! But it’s like, there’s no way there’ll be a single
kouhai who’ll want to partner up with me, though! Are you
seriously saying that a complete moron like me has to somehow
make this work with just my communication skills?!” wailed Ike.
His lamentation was entirely justified. The chances of
someone needing a student with poor grades, like him, were quite
low until that someone ran out of options for other students they
wanted to team up with.
That is, if you were doing things the proper way, of course.
“Don’t worry. The school has taken certain things into
account to ensure no one gets left behind, no matter how many
students fail to find partners. In the event that you are unable to
pair with someone before the special exam is held, pairings will be</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_48">
<p>selected randomly at eight in the morning on the day of the test,”
explained Chabashira.
Ike held a hand up to his chest after hearing what could be
interpreted as a measure intended to provide us with relief. But
that moment of relief was short-lived.
“That being said, students who fail to find a partner will not
be treated the same as students who did find partners. Therefore,
any pair created via the method I just described—the one where
you run out of time and have someone chosen at random for you
—will be subject to a penalty of five percent of your total score,”
said Chabashira.
The entire class let out wails of agony after hearing about
the five-percent penalty. While the system they had in place meant
you could still take the exam, you’d still suffer a painful setback.
“Sensei, three students have been expelled so far from our
grade. Won’t that mean there will be three extra first-year
students?” asked Yousuke.
Upon hearing such a trivial question, Chabashira answered
him in an indifferent tone.
“The three extra students will be compensated in the form of
having their points doubled. However, they will also be subjected
to the same five percent penalty for not finding a partner I
mentioned previously, so I’m sure not many of them will be happy
about the thought of being left alone.”
So each of those three people would be taking the exam
alone, filling both roles of their respective pair themselves. I
supposed it would be fine if three first-year students with excellent
academic skills were alone, then.
However, I couldn’t afford to only worry about Ike and Sudou
during this exam. Because this special exam was most certainly
going to be exceptionally difficult for me.
The reason it was going to be so difficult was the part where
you’d get expelled if your total score was five hundred points or
below. To put it another way, that meant my partner, who would
be quite important to me clearing the special exam, had to get at</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_49">
<p>least one point. Even if I got a perfect score in all five subjects, if
my partner scored a zero, then expulsion would be unavoidable.
Under normal circumstances, this would be a dangerous and
extremely pointed rule. Since first-year students faced no risk of
expulsion themselves, they could purposefully botch the test or get
a low score to force their second-year partner to be expelled… But
the school had devised another rule to stop that kind of thing from
happening.
“In addition, any student determined to have manipulated
their scores, such as by purposefully answering questions
incorrectly, will be expelled, regardless of their grade level.
Similarly, in the event that a third party has been found to have
forced another student to lower their score, that third party will be
expelled.”
You could say that part was both incredibly important and
indispensable to this special exam’s legitimacy. It was a measure
put in place to prevent malicious behavior, like someone trying to
extort Private Points out of another student by threatening to
purposefully throw the exam. With this rule in place, you couldn’t
blatantly cut corners on the test. Also, the average students would
be safer.
However, while these rules would normally be enough to put
my worries to rest, they were not adequate to make this test a
sure thing this time. That was because…for a student from the
White Room, it was a different story.
The student from the White Room was operating on the
premise that they were going to get expelled eventually, anyway.
That rule wasn’t going to stop them. If that student successfully
managed to pair up with me, they probably wouldn’t hesitate to
purposefully score a zero on the test. Meaning, if I happen to
choose the student from the White Room as my partner, that’s it,
I’m out.
Once the special exam began, there was a one-in-one-
hundred-and-sixty chance or higher that I’ll get expelled. Now, if
there was a rule that stated something like, “In the event a
student’s partner is expelled due to some form of dishonest
behavior, the other student in the partnership will be treated as</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_50">
<p>having gotten a passing grade, without further penalty,” that would
be good. However, as far as I could tell, no such guarantees were
present. The fact that no one had bothered to bring that point up
was a result of the self-serving assumption that no student would
purposefully go out of their way to do something that would result
in their own expulsion.
Well, no. It wasn’t just that. In the unlikely event that a
student did do such a thing, the school would probably take
immediate action to deal with it. I was sure they’d probably decree
that expelling a student who’d simply been the victim of someone
else’s cheating would be too harsh.
But I was also sure that if I, and only I, were the one in such
a situation, that man would enforce the punishment. He’d say it
was my fault for pairing up with a student who didn’t take the
exam seriously.
He’d purposefully put a small loophole in the rules to let him
react to things as he needed in the moment. The image of
Tsukishiro flickered in the back of my mind. These were most
definitely rules that he had produced. There was no way he would
miss the opportunity presented by this special exam. If I hemmed
and hawed and lagged behind the other students in choosing a
partner, it would mean people other than the new White Room
student would be partnering up, increasing my chances of ending
up with the White Room agent.
It would be nice if I could act quickly to pair up with a
student whom I didn’t think was from the White Room, but my
academic ability, as rated by OAA, was C. I wasn’t exactly in a
position to pick and choose partners as I pleased. But even if I
tried to pick a first-year with a poor score in that department, they
probably wouldn’t allow me to pair up with them, unable to shake
their uneasiness at me being ranked C in terms of academic ability.
In that case, I would probably have to find a partner who
was also around C-rank in academic ability and wouldn’t mind
pairing up with me. But it was possible that my opponent was
already lying in wait, anticipating me doing so, ready to ambush
me.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_51">
<p>As soon as I heard the rules explained, I was certain this test
was going to be a bigger challenge than any I’d faced before.
“Sensei, about how difficult is this exam going to be?” asked
Horikita, raising her hand and posing a critical question.
“To be perfectly frank, there are going to be many extremely
tough questions on this exam. You could say it will, without a
doubt, be one of the most difficult exams that you’ve ever taken.
But…that’s only if you’re aiming to get a high score, though. This
test is designed in such a way that even a student with an
academic ability ranking of around E can get at least one hundred
and fifty points without any prior preparation. If you study for a
few days, you’ll probably get around two hundred points. And,
well, this is only a rough approximation, but…”
Chabashira directed our attention to the screen, which
displayed a list of estimated scores split up by academic ability
ranking.
 
Academic Ability E: 150 – 200 Points
Academic Ability D: 200 – 250 Points
Academic Ability C: 250 – 300 Points
Academic Ability B: Around 350 Points
Academic Ability A: Around 400 Points
 
“If you prepare for this test properly, you should score
somewhere around the numbers shown here. But don’t forget that
if you get overconfident and neglect your studies, you might
obviously end up scoring lower,” said Chabashira, before quickly
adding that we shouldn’t get too confident about the numbers we
saw displayed on the screen. “Also, as I’m sure you can see if you
look at the part where a student with A-ranked academic ability
gets around four hundred points, it’s unlikely for a student to get
over ninety points in every subject, let alone perfect score on this
exam.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_52">
<p>That was probably a direct reflection of what she’d said
earlier about this being the most difficult exam we’d faced so far.
In any case, if two students with an academic ability near E-rank
were paired up, they would most definitely be in danger of being
expelled.
“Well, then, I’ve finished providing an overview of the special
exam to be held in April. Please buckle down and prepare yourself
for the challenge,” said Chabashira.
She went on to verbally explain the scope of the test
questions. Apparently, according to her, we should be all right as
long as we thoroughly went over the material that we had learned
in our first year.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_53">
<p>3.3
 
ONCE THAT WAS OVER and we entered the break between
classes, many students inevitably huddled around Yousuke. Upon
seeing that, Horikita also immediately got up from her seat and
went over to join them. I decided I’d listen in on their conversation
for the time being.
“Wh-wh-wh-what do I do, Hirata?! My academic ability
ranking is E! I’m totally up the creek without a paddle, man!” Ike
wailed, clutching his head, begging Yousuke for help.
Yousuke scanned his eyes over the entire class as he thought
of a way to calm Ike down. “Okay, first, just calm down. Then let’s
try and come up with a plan of action.”
“Yes. There’s no need to panic,” added Horikita.
“B-but, dude!!” wailed Ike.
“This definitely isn’t an easy exam, that’s for sure. In order to
ensure that you get a score of five hundred and one points or
higher, a student with an academic ability rank of E needs to be
paired up with a first-year student of B rank or better. To put it
another way, if you’re paired with a student of B rank or better,
you should be able to fairly safely pass this exam.”
Horikita explained that what Ike needed to do to get through
this test wasn’t all that complicated, perhaps to calm him down.
“Besides, we’ve already worked together and overcome
similar tests in the year we’ve been here. If we stay as united as
we have until now and make sure to fully prepare, it’s not
impossible for you to get over two hundred and fifty, or even three
hundred points,” she added.
“Yes. It’s exactly like Horikita-san says. If we all work
together, I’m sure we can all pass this exam without a hitch,”
added Yousuke.
The combination of what Horikita and Yousuke were saying
gradually made everyone else around them start to calm down,
little by little.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_54">
<p>“The important thing is to not pick a partner lightly. The only
instance where you’d be able to make a split-second decision
would be if a first-year student with an academic ability ranking of
B or better is willing to partner with you,” said Yousuke.
It was certainly true that once a student decided on a
partner, they couldn’t undo it. You had to be absolutely certain that
you were picking a partner who could put you both over the five-
hundred-point threshold.
“As for those of you who have academic ability rankings of
B+ or higher, I’d like for you to not rush to any conclusions. It
might be important to keep a certain number of good students
available if we’re going to save everyone. At any rate, regardless of
whether you’re academically capable or not, please make sure to
consult with either Hirata-kun or myself if anything does come up,”
said Horikita.
She’d said only the bare minimum she needed to right now,
asking for everyone not to panic and make any rash decisions. The
honors students like Keisei and Mii-chan nodded along without
hesitation, showing that they would cooperate. I supposed Horikita
could have taken on the responsibility of negotiating partnerships
for everyone in class, but that would be difficult to carry out the
process smoothly. Since there were rivals competing for
partnerships, this would also be a fight against time.
“I think I’ll try negotiating with some of the kids in soccer, for
the time being. There are some first-years in there who are good
students, and I think we might be able to get some partnerships
set up,” Yousuke replied after listening intently to what Horikita
just said, directing his comment at her.
Throwing more people at the problem was also a satisfactory
solution.
“If you’re okay with that, then yes, please do. Your help
would be invaluable,” said Horikita.
An activity related to club activity wasn’t really in her field of
expertise. Yousuke smiled warmly, nodding.
“Also, I think we should hold a meeting for the students who
have an academic ability ranking of C- or lower, just in case,” he</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_55">
<p>said.
“That sounds like the right call to me. Let’s work together to
try and find partners for everyone,” said Horikita.
Just being able to explain the plan of attack to everyone in
class right away, like this, would probably make all the difference.
That way, they could address all areas of weakness, and everyone
in class would have some peace of mind, knowing they weren’t
being abandoned.
“Horikita-san, just one more thing—”
“There are some students who have an academic ability
ranking of C or better who aren’t particularly good at holding
dialog. I intend to follow up with those who would struggle to form
a partnership for reasons other than their academic scores,” said
Horikita.
They were quick-witted enough to understand each other
without even needing to go into detail. They were perfectly in
sync, with the only the bare minimum amount of discussion
required.
“Thank you. That would be great,” replied Yousuke.
Horikita and Yousuke continued making plans without any
hiccups, continuing to sort out the situation in a way they both
agreed with. Though they had clashed once before, they were
working together almost unbelievably well right now, not just
because Horikita was becoming a more amicable person, but also
because of Yousuke’s flexible way of thinking.
“By the way, Sudou-kun. How are things with the basketball
club? I’m sure some first-year students must have joined, right?”
said Horikita, seeking Sudou’s opinion, since he was rather
enthusiastic about his club activities.
However, when she asked him that question, he averted his
eyes, seeming somewhat embarrassed.
“Y-yeah, but…” said Sudou.
“But?” asked Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_56">
<p>“Well, it’s only been a few days since we’ve started club stuff,
but well, we’ve been takin’ a pretty, y’know, Spartan approach. Or
like… Well, you know,” said Sudou.
“You mean you’ve been hard on them, then?” said Horikita.
“Well, yeah, I guess you could put it that way. I mean,
basketball is pretty hardcore,” said Sudou.
I supposed the point he was making was that he might
already be in a position where people disliked him. Of course, that
was precisely because he took basketball so seriously. The first-
years would be very divided on whether they liked or disliked a
senior who was strict when it came to practice.
“I understand. Just concentrate on your studies for the time
being, and try not to think about the special exam.” Horikita
decided to give Sudou a stern warning, since it might backfire on
him if he went ahead and did something careless.
“O-okay,” said Sudou.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_57">
<p>3.4
 
OUR LUNCH BREAK came next. After I had finished eating,
Horikita called me out into the hallway.
“This isn’t something we should discuss in the classroom. If
we talk here, we’ll know if anyone comes by,” said Horikita.
“Okay, so? This is about the upcoming special exam, isn’t it?”
I asked.
“Yes, it is. We’ve been told by Chabashira-sensei that the
coming special exam will be quite challenging. It will certainly be
an ordeal for students with less academic ability, but for you and
me, it will be the ideal setting for our competition,” said Horikita.
She must have wanted to address personal matters first,
because she opened right with that. Horikita and I had promised
each other something over spring break. Namely, that we would
compete to see who could get the highest score on a written
exam, in one particular subject. If I won, Horikita would join the
student council. If Horikita won, I would, freely and without
reservation, employ the skills that I had been hiding over the past
year for the sake of the class.
We had been advised that it would be difficult for even a
student with A-rank academic abilities to score ninety points or
higher in one subject on the test. If the difficulty level was that
high, it was unlikely we’d both end up getting perfect scores and
thus have a tie.
“I trust you have no issues with that?” said Horikita,
confirming that I had no objections about settling the matter in the
upcoming written test.
“Of course not.” Since there was nothing for me to gain by
pointlessly delaying things further, I agreed with her request like it
was a matter of course.
“Glad to hear it. Well, I suppose we can move onto the next
topic of discussion right away, then.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_58">
<p>Horikita, satisfied that I had reaffirmed the promise we had
made, pulled out her phone. She then launched the OAA app we
had just installed that morning.
“I looked up the number of honors students in the first-year
classes who have an academic ability ranking of B or better. There
were seventeen in Class A, thirteen in Class B, thirteen in Class C,
and eleven in Class D,” said Horikita.
A total of fifty-four, then. You could say that was a pretty
reasonable percentage of students.
“In our class, there are only four students who are ranked E
for academic ability. If you include students ranked D, that’s a total
of twelve people. So, we’re in a position where we have more than
enough manpower in the first-year classes to cover those
students,” said Horikita.
“The question, then, is how many of those honors students
we can draw over to us in Class D, I suppose.”
Even though there were fifty-four students, it was inevitable
there would be a mad scramble to snatch them up. If we dropped
the ball, it was possible they’d all be stolen out from under us.
“Yes. The class that is able to secure many of those fifty-four
students will naturally be in an advantageous position, while the
class that partners with a large number of D+ or lower-ranked
students will simply be at a disadvantage,” said Horikita.
That app that was just introduced to us came equipped with
some very extremely useful features. The class that used those
features well would be most likely to win.
“Sakayanagi-san, Ryuuen-san, and even Ichinose-san… I’m
sure all of the classes will be making their move starting today,”
said Horikita.
Of the leaders, Class A’s Sakayanagi would most likely launch
her attack right away. All she had to do was take advantage of the
fact that she was in the class with the fewest students who were
worried about their level of academic ability, and work hard to
bring as many of the smartest first-year students over to their side
as possible. Even from the perspective of a first-year student, the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_59">
<p>stability of Class A was something that could immediately be
understood just by looking at the OAA app. If they worked with
Class A, they could easily rake in the top-tier rewards.
We, on the other hand, didn’t have that luxury.
“First and foremost, we should be prioritizing helping our
classmates who are ranked E and D in academic ability to find
partners of higher rank,” I replied.
Horikita nodded lightly in agreement.
“I wouldn’t call it complete or anything, but I’ve produced a
list of people to prioritize finding partners for. I think Sudou-kun
should be the one we take care of first.”
“Hold on a minute. It’s true that Sudou’s academic ability
ranking is E, but do you think that’s really what we need to do?” I
asked.
Sudou’s grades when he first started school here were
exceptionally bad, and he’d received an E-ranking as a result.
However, in the latter half of the first year, we saw his academic
performance slowly begin to improve little by little. Meaning it
wouldn’t be surprising at all if he were actually a little bit better
now than he used to be.
“Yes, I suppose you’ve got a point… It’s true that he’s
matured quite a bit, compared to how he was before. Even during
spring break, Sudou-kun spent a lot of time wrapped up in his
studies, trying to improve areas that he was lagging in before,”
said Horikita.
“Were you having study sessions with him?” I asked.
“Absolutely not. I don’t have the kind of time to hang around
him every day. He’s learned how to study by himself, to a certain
extent. I just drop in and check his progress once every few days,
and then head back,” said Horikita.
“Huh…”
I thought he was putting in an effort because Horikita was
with him. Honestly, that was some really impressive dedication on
Sudou’s part.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_60">
<p>“To be honest, I think Sudou-kun’s ranking has probably
gone up a little bit… I feel like even when compared to other
students, he’s gone up to D or D+,” said Horikita.
Of course, that was nothing more than a simple and
optimistic estimate. But speaking as someone who knew what
Sudou was like a year ago, he had definitely matured quite a bit.
“If I remember correctly, the old Sudou used to panic a lot
when we heard about special exams, and he’d get really upset.
He’s calmed down a lot,” I told her.
Then again, he did kick up a fuss about stuff like scoring
worse than Kouenji in the societal contribution category.
“So, even though by your reckoning he’s a D or better, you
still think he’s a higher priority than Ike?” I added.
“His personality and appearance both played a big part in my
decision. What he said about the rather heavy-handed attitude he’s
been taking with the new students in his club also caught my
attention,” said Horikita.
It sounded like she had arrived at her decision not because
she was playing favorites with Sudou, but because she had
properly analyzed the situation.
“Let’s suppose you’re a first-year student who doesn’t know
anything… Who do you think would be easier to team up with,
Sudou-kun or Ike-kun? Assuming that they have the same exact
grades, on the surface,” said Horikita.
“Well, I guess I’d have to say Ike,” I replied.
Sudou’s gigantic height, imposing physique, red hair, and
stern tone certainly made a frightening first impression. If I had to
pair up with someone who had the same academic ranking as him,
I would want to pick Ike, thinking he might be easier to deal with.
“Forget about finding someone with a high level of academic
skill—simply finding any partner at all for him might be a
challenge,” said Horikita.
Which was precisely why she had placed him at the top of
her list of students to help, I supposed.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_61">
<p>“I understand. If at all possible, I’d like to pair him up with a
first-year student who has an academic ability ranking of B- or
better,” I replied.
“Yes. If we do that, I think he can definitely make it through.
I’d like to move quickly. Can you help me?” asked Horikita.
“Help? I can’t really think of any way that I can help,
though.”
“You can just stick by me and tell me what you think. I just
want someone that I can trust by my side,” said Horikita.
“Meaning, you trust me?”
“Of those of our classmates who can move around freely, I
trust you,” she replied.
Based on how she phrased that, I wasn’t exactly sure if that
meant she trusted me a lot or a little…
“Or are you perhaps worried that you won’t be able to beat
me if you take even a single minute away from your studies?” she
asked.
That attempt at provocation was actually rather
counterproductive. She was just giving me the perfect excuse to
get out of helping her by claiming I needed to study in my room
because I was apparently nervous
“Yeah, I’m very worried—”
Just when I was about to graciously take advantage of the
excuse I’d been given, my phone started to vibrate. There was a
public message from the leader of Class 2-B, Ichinose Honami,
posted in the OAA app for everyone to read.
“We just got permission to hold a meet-and-greet for first-
and second-years in the gym today from 4 to 5 p.m. If you’ve got
time to spare, please stop by!”
The message was a godsend for the students who were
struggling to figure out how to get in touch with the first-years.
“Just as I’d expect from Ichinose-san. Well done. It’s just like
her to think of everyone, not just her own group,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_62">
<p>While it was unclear exactly how many people would be
attending this meet-and-greet, I could imagine a fair number of
people would be there. It was highly likely that partnerships might
be formed right then and there. But rather than joy, I could see a
hint of something like frustration on Horikita’s face. She might
have been thinking of a similar strategy.
“What’s the matter? The special exam’s only just started,
right?”
“Yes, yes, you’re right. I suppose that our first order of
business has been decided,” said Horikita.
I guessed she meant we were going to be attending the
meet-and-greet after class today. And, before I knew it, I guessed
it had been decided that I was helping her. Well, I supposed it
wasn’t that big a deal if all I was doing was tagging along, but…
Horikita shot me a look, as if she knew what I was thinking
and was testing me.
“All right. I’ll go,” I told her.
“Oh, my. Are you really going to lend me a hand, then? I
thought you’d been avoiding me lately, but… Well, you’re being
quite cooperative, aren’t you?” said Horikita.
Wow, that was impressive. The person who was aware of the
fact I was avoiding her just openly calling me out about it like that.
“I was just thinking of keeping a close eye on you to see
what kind of strategy you come up with,” I replied.
“I see. I might have been a bit hasty in using the word
‘cooperative’ then.”
Even so, Horikita seemed like she was satisfied with my
answer. That answer was just a pretext, though. This was a test
where I had to put on an act if I was going to survive. There were
some things that would be easier for me to deal with if I were
working together with Horikita.
“In that case, you can think of what I’m about to say next as
me just talking to myself. While it’s true that getting Sudou-kun
and Ike-kun over the threshold to pass this exam is a major
prerequisite, this special exam is based on the idea of competing</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_63">
<p>to snatch up the best students. So naturally, we need to pay close
attention to what Ryuuen-kun and Sakayanagi-san are doing…
Meaning, we need to be mindful of their strategies,” said Horikita.
Although what she’d just said was completely obvious, the
old Horikita wouldn’t have thought this far ahead already. She
would probably have only concentrated on making sure Sudou and
the other students made it through, and neglected to keep track of
the enemy’s strategy. However, this time around, she was being
extremely cautious right from the start.
“Of course, I don’t know exactly what those two are going to
do at this current point in time. But I think Private Points will be a
key part of it,” said Horikita.
Meaning cash. Horikita was saying that at this school, the
power of Private Points spoke for itself. As of right now, there was
no connection whatsoever between the first-years and the second-
years. Which meant that the best way to wrap up any negotiation
quickly was to use Private Points.
“I don’t know exactly how much financial muscle Class A and
Class C have at their disposal, but if we’re competing to recruit
students, I’m sure buying people out or bribery will be their go-to
strategies,” said Horikita.
“Yeah. Points will be the easiest thing for the new students to
understand.”
It was easy to imagine people paying out a number of points
corresponding to how well students could perform academically.
However, if all sides carelessly threw wads of cash around to fight
this battle, then our stores of Private Points would be depleted in
no time. That was especially true for Class D, since we’d been in a
financially stagnant situation for the past year. We didn’t even
need to run an actual comparison to know that our sum of points
—or rather, our financial power—fell far short of what the other
classes had.
“Under normal circumstances, we should also invest some
money to secure a certain number of students,” I added.
The only thing that could compete with money was,
essentially, money itself. Playing the money game was necessary</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_64">
<p>to see who could offer more. However, the fact that Horikita
seemed somewhat frustrated about the message Ichinose had
posted earlier must have meant…
“First, let’s do some reconnaissance at the meet-and-greet. If
an opportunity presents itself, we might move quickly, but
otherwise, I don’t intend to rush. That’s fine with me,” said
Horikita.
Perhaps she hadn’t firmly settled on a plan of action yet,
because she didn’t go into more detail about her plans.
“By the way, Ayanokouji-kun. Am I correct in assuming that
you can find a partner on your own?” she asked.
“Would you find me one if I asked you?” I replied.
“Speaking objectively, your academic ability is C. So basically,
it should be fine no matter who you partner up with. It should be
easy enough for me to manage while I’m already dealing with
other things, though,” said Horikita.
“Well, if I run into any trouble, I’ll come to you.”
I could rule out any first-year students who decided to
partner with Horikita or Yousuke as White Room agents. It wasn’t
out of the question for me to try asking them at the last minute,
before the pairing was finalized, if I could switch in to replace
them. However, if my opponent knew everything ahead of time,
they would probably take into the account the possibility of me
making that choice when I was in trouble. Since all I could do was
try to predict their actions and then to outmaneuver them, it was
difficult for me to say I had a one-hundred percent chance of
evading them with that method.
More importantly, I was sure the first-year student wouldn’t
exactly be thrilled about being forced to swap partners after they
had already decided to partner up with Horikita or Yousuke. They
wouldn’t agree to that easily.
“You’d best not take too long, though. It’s not like there’s
nothing for you to be worried about. A five-percent penalty for
running out of time isn’t a small price to pay,” said Horikita.
“Yeah, that’s true,” I replied.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_65">
<p>While I wasn’t exactly planning to take my time, I was
worried about the person from the White Room. I was sure,
beyond a shadow of a doubt, that whoever it was had already
blended in amongst the first-years.</p>
</div>

<p class="chapter">Chapter 4:</p>
These New First-Years are Nothing But
Troublemakers
 
THERE WERE DOZENS of first- and second-year students
gathered in the gym. Most of the people there weren’t second-
years, but first-years. I supposed that many students saw this
meet-and-greet as an important opportunity.
Since I didn’t know who the first-years were at a glance right
now anyway, I decided to start by finding out which second-year
students were participating in this event.
The leader of Class A, Sakayanagi, was nowhere to be seen.
And while I didn’t know if I could exactly call him a stand-in for
her, I did see Hashimoto Masayoshi. Sakayanagi had a disability
affecting her legs, so her range of movement was limited, making
her slow. Hashimoto played an important part in covering her to
make up for that.
As far as I could tell, he was the only person from Class A
here. Furthermore, it didn’t seem like he was making an attempt to
talk to anyone in particular. He was probably scouting around to
see who got in touch with whom at this meet-and-greet.
As the organizer for this event, about half of the people from
Class B were in attendance, both guys and girls, Ichinose included.
Kanzaki was there too, by Ichinose’s side, supporting her. However,
I didn’t get the impression that the students in attendance from
Class B were those that were either very good students or those
who were concerned about their academic prowess. It seemed
Class B had simply chosen to send the more sociable members of
their class.
On the other hand, after briefly looking around, I saw no
sign of anyone from Class C around. It was almost as if they
considered this meet-and-greet to be totally optional, right from
the very beginning. Through this one event alone, you could
somehow see the motives of each of the second-year classes.
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_67">
<p>However, it wasn’t the second-year students who were
important to Horikita today. She was focused on the first-years—
the people we hardly knew at all. I was sure that the first-year
students, who had only just started here, had no clue as to what
was going on yet. Many of them were probably struggling to wrap
their heads around the situation with second-year students
suddenly asking to pair up with them. They shrank back from
everyone else at the event, clinging to their classmates—which is
to say, the students that they were already close with.
Upon seeing that, Ichinose tried her best to expand their
circle by making self-introductions and casual chit-chat, without
really mentioning the special exam. Of course, it wasn’t like people
were about to immediately open up or anything. Knowing this, she
didn’t rush things, but instead approached people slowly, looking
at them with a gentle smile on her face. Then their hardened
hearts, which seemed to have been frozen like ice, began to thaw.
After only a few minutes of observation at this meet-and-
greet, I had a general idea of how things were going to go from
here.
“Rather than prioritizing the special exam, she’s going about
building relationships based on mutual trust, first. That is certainly
a very Ichinose-san-like way of doing things. An admirable tactic,
and one not everyone can pull off,” said Horikita, giving her first
impression of the meet-and-greet.
It was unknown just how much Class B was going to make
use of this strategy, but it was especially important, nonetheless.
What Ichinose was doing could only benefit both the first- and
second-year students. Horikita called Ichinose “admirable” for
putting such a plan into action. Looking at Horikita’s side profile, I
could guess at the strategy she must have been thinking of herself.
“Are you thinking of a similar strategy yourself?” I asked.
“…Yes. A strategy based on using Private Points is too much
for Class D to handle. That’s why I thought it would be important
for us to build relationships based on trust with the first-years.
However, we’re no match for Ichinose-san in that regard at all. Or
rather, I should say, that kind of strategy is her specialty,” said
Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_68">
<p>If you wanted someone to accept you as their partner, you
needed to offer them something. That something could be a lot of
different things, like points, trust, friendship, or a debt of gratitude.
“Ichinose Honami-san from Class 2-B is already quite well-
known among many of the first-years. They know her name and
face. I’m sure anxious students will flock to her, and she’ll live up
to their expectations,” added Horikita.
“Yeah, I think so too,” I replied.
They weren’t going to bother coming up to us, Class 2-D,
people they didn’t know at all.
“But even if we can’t duplicate her admirable methods, there
are things we can do,” said Horikita.
Apparently, Horikita had gotten some kind of idea from this
event. The crux of that idea probably had something to do with
how she was constantly looking at the first-years with the OAA app
open. She gave no sign of wanting to leave yet, continuing to
observe the first-years.
I wasn’t the only one standing beside her, watching, either. A
large figure moved by us.
“But, y’know, all of ’em look like total wimps. Every last one
of ’em,” gruffed Sudou, standing beside Horikita, sharing what he
thought about the first-years.
Sudou had originally planned to head straight for his club
activities right after class today. But because Ichinose’s request to
hold this meet-and-greet event was accepted, and it was thus
suddenly decided that the gym would be in use until five o’clock,
he offered to accompany Horikita here. Horikita had flatly turned
him down, telling him it wasn’t necessary for him to come, but I
guess it must have been fine in the end, since he was going to the
gym anyway.
“Don’t glare at them for no reason. There’s nothing to gain
by scaring them,” said Horikita.
“I ain’t really glarin’ or anything. This is just the way my face
looks. Anyway, is it really okay for us to hang back and chill like
this? Won’t the brainy kids get snatched up by Ichinose? What’s</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_69">
<p>the harm in just talkin’ to ’em?” said Sudou impatiently, suggesting
to Horikita that they ought to go and talk to the students sooner
rather than later.
Even if a student from our grade level that wasn’t in Class B
went to make a move on one of the first-years, Ichinose wouldn’t
get upset about it. If anything, I was sure she’d welcome that
happily.
“What are you gonna do?” I asked Horikita, since I’d been
wondering about that myself.
“Do you really think we can outdo Class 2-B in a place like
this, when it comes to socializing?” asked Horikita.
Right now, Ichinose seemed to be emphasizing providing
relief for the first-years over trying to make sure her own class
would win. From the looks of things, not a single one of the
students from Class B had left yet, and they seemed to be trying
to get to know the first-years better, to deepen their friendships. I
bet the first-years had noticed their enthusiasm, too.
“Yeah, I can’t really imagine that we could,” I replied.
If Yousuke or Kushida were here, we could’ve stood a chance
at schmoozing. Maybe. But Horikita, Sudou, and I most definitely
lacked the ability to hold our own, socially. I was sure Horikita was
well aware of that fact when she came here.
Just as the discussion was about to begin in earnest, Horikita
took action.
“…Let’s go,” she said.
Instead of participating in the meet-and-greet, we were
retreating. Which meant Horikita had had no intention of trying to
bring any of the first-years over to our side at this event all along.
“You sure that’s okay, Suzune?” asked Sudou.
“More than half of the students who were invited didn’t come
to this meet-and-greet. Those are the students I’m going to
negotiate with,” said Horikita.
In other words, she was going to target the first-year
students who hadn’t bothered to listen to Ichinose’s offer. At the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_70">
<p>same time, however, the fact that those students ignored
Ichinose’s offer proved it would be difficult to win them over. They
might think they could find a partner by themselves, based on
their own abilities, without accepting a helping hand. Or perhaps
they lacked the courage to come out to this meet-and-greet. They
might even already have a strategy in mind. Whatever the case
might be, we could assume many of them probably would be a
little eccentric, and hard to deal with.
“For the time being, let’s hear your basis for going that
route,” I said.
“Two reasons. As far as I can tell, from what I saw just
moments earlier, an unexpectedly high percentage of the students
who came to the meet-and-greet were people concerned about
their academic prowess. What we are looking for right now, rather
urgently I might add, are students who have at least a B minus or
better in academic ability. Meaning, the students who have enough
confidence to do battle without coming to the meet-and-greet,”
said Horikita.
I see. If that was the case, I supposed it made a certain
amount of sense for us to have left the meet-and-greet.
“Our top priority shouldn’t be to pair two A-rank students
with one another. It’s about coaxing students with enough
academic ability to cover for the weaker students in our class to
come to our side, to make sure that absolutely no one gets
expelled,” said Horikita.
However, even if Class 2-B did save a lot of the first-years,
there would naturally be a lot of them left over. Moreover, Ichinose
was probably going to prioritize saving the less capable students
over helping the highly capable ones. It was possible that we could
have picked up some of the leftover students from the meet-and-
greet—ones who were better students, to an extent.
I assumed her second reason had something to do with that.
“Besides, there was a little bit of a bias in the students who
attended the meet-and-greet, regardless of academic ability,” said
Horikita.
“Bias?”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_71">
<p>“The fact that none of the students from Class 1-D attended
at all,” said Horikita.
None of them had attended? I see. That certainly was a
rather interesting bias.
“It seems like you understand, too,” Horikita said.
“Understand what? What does the fact that none of the kids
from Class 1-D showed up mean?” asked Sudou, cutting in.
He cocked his head to the side, not understanding what the
significance of their absence was.
“There are forty people in one class. Among those forty are
students with poor grades and students who aren’t particularly
good at communication. And yet, not a single person from Class 1-
D participated. The fact that no one had attended is obviously a
reflection of the will of the class,” said Horikita.
It was clear that someone was controlling the entire class,
and had instructed them not to participate in the meet-and-greet.
You could certainly say that was unusual, considering that it hadn’t
even been a few days since the semester started.
“So, you’re sayin’ there’s already a leader in their class, and
that person’s kept ’em from going to this meet-and-greet…?” said
Sudou.
“If there’s a person we can negotiate with who speaks for
the entire class, then it’s no longer necessary for us to try and
bargain with people individually,” said Horikita.
In other words, her strategy was for the students in each of
our classes, 1-D and 2-D, to cover one another.
“Okay, that’s all well and good. But if we do that, we’re not
gonna stand a chance at winnin’ this thing, are we?” Sudou asked.
It wasn’t a bad idea at all, to keep anyone from getting
expelled. But it would probably make it impossible for us to beat
the other classes in overall scores.
“You’re right. In that sense, I’m not planning to wage war
with the other classes this time around,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_72">
<p>“I ain’t exactly in a position to really say much of anythin’
about that, but are you sure that’s what you want?” said Sudou.
“Yes. Without a doubt,” stated Horikita, clearly and
definitively.
Although her approach was certainly different, the general
idea behind her strategy was similar to Ichinose’s, from the sound
of it. The thinking was that you’d be giving up your chance at a
valuable opportunity to get Class Points, a special exam.
Class A’s Hashimoto was already leaving the gym, perhaps
because he was done snooping around Ichinose’s meet-and-greet
event. Horikita followed Hashimoto, proceeding to the gym exit.
Sudou and I followed her. But just before I left, I briefly looked
back at Ichinose.
Ichinose, not noticing my presence, was talking to a first-
year student with a smile on her face. I was sure she wouldn’t
hesitate to extend a helping hand, regardless of that student’s
academic ability score. Even if it was D or E.
She was fighting to prevent anyone in her class from getting
expelled, abandoning the idea of achieving victory in this special
exam. It was about the same as what Horikita was trying to do,
albeit in a different way. Or was it? Was the essence of their
strategies really the same?
“Yo.”
Just as we left the gym, Hashimoto called out to us, as if he
had been waiting for us.
“Man, she’s the same as ever, isn’t she? Ichinose, I mean,”
he said.
“It seems she’s prioritizing saving her classmates and the
first-years, yes,” said Horikita.
“Yeah, for sure. Definitely doesn’t seem like Ichinose’s a
threat at the moment. Doesn’t she get what a disadvantage it’ll be
for her to take in a bunch of morons? Man, it’s like she’s throwin’
the game,” said Hashimoto exasperatedly.
There was no way he could have realized Horikita was going
for pretty much the same thing, probably because he couldn’t even</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_73">
<p>imagine the thought of Horikita giving up on trying to win.
“Maybe it’s because she already knew that about the first-
years that she was able to set up a meeting like this in the first
place?” said Horikita.
“Ah, yeah, I getcha. That’s true,” said Hashimoto.
“You Class A people… Sakayanagi-san understood without
even needing to see the meet-and-greet. The reason she didn’t
participate was because she already anticipated what kind of
students were going to show up here,” said Horikita.
“Well, maybe,” said Hashimoto.
Even so, she had probably sent Hashimoto in alone as a
scout.
“So, how are you planning to get the honors students over to
your side?” asked Horikita.
“That’s all up to the princess. I’m just following her orders.”
With that reply, Hashimoto started to walk away, perhaps
because he was satisfied with the brief exchange we just had.
“Don’t trust a word that jerkoff Hashimoto says, Suzune.”
“You don’t need to tell me that. Wait, are you familiar with
Hashimoto-kun?” asked Horikita.
“Nope, not at all,” said Sudou proudly, arrogantly.
“…I see. Well, Class A has a big advantage simply by being
Class A. I suppose it’s only natural that they’ll have some people
flocking to them, to a certain extent,” said Horikita.
Having enrolled here, the new students were eventually
going to realize that Class A reigned supreme. Even if they didn’t
know that fact right now, word would get around quickly.
“Anyway, let’s hurry. Class D students should still be hanging
around at school at this hour,” said Horikita, heading towards the
first-year classrooms.
We were going to see what things were like for Class 1-D.
Apparently, she was seizing the opportunity presented to us while
everyone else was focused on the meet-and-greet.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_74">
<p>4.1
WE MADE OUR WAY to the floor where the first-year students
were—the floor we’d been regularly going to until just last month.
There didn’t seem to be many students around, considering that
quite a few had gone over to the gym. We looked around and saw
several students, from Class A through Class C. Even though we
didn’t actually call out to them, when they spotted us and
recognized us as upperclassmen, they looked away, as if it were
awkward or uncomfortable.
I supposed there was no way we’d be welcomed with open
arms all that easily, after suddenly setting foot on the first-years’
floor. There were a few students who didn’t seem to mind us, but
most of them didn’t exactly like the uncomfortable awkwardness of
having us there. That would probably be the case tomorrow, and
every day thereafter, too.
I was sure that some students, trying to find a partner as
soon as possible, would approach first-years at all times of the day,
both mornings and afternoons. But that was a dangerous gamble
that might end up backfiring. Even so, there were students
chatting and laughing happily in the first-year classrooms into
which we peeked. Maybe they felt like there was no need to panic
about this special exam. Or perhaps they didn’t see it as that big a
deal yet.
“Well, it seems like a lot of the students who had stayed
behind aren’t too worried, after all,” said Horikita.
“Well, that’s nice. And here I’m freakin’ out and all,” gruffed
Sudou.
The first-year students would only have their Private Point
payouts suspended for three months if they scored five hundred
points or less on the exam. That was still definitely a huge loss, of
course, but since the initial deposit into their accounts should have
been made right after the entrance ceremony, they probably felt
no sense of impending danger.
Just as we were finishing our inspection of Class 1-C, Horikita
heard a familiar voice call out to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_75">
<p>“Ku ku. You got here pretty late, Suzune.”
The owner of that voice was none other than Ryuuen Kakeru,
from Class 2-C, staring at us fearlessly. Just up ahead, we could
see the classroom for Class 1-D. It looked like Ryuuen had just
stepped out of that room.
“Are you here scouting out first-year students too, Ryuuen-
kun? I don’t recall seeing you at the meet-and-greet,” said
Horikita.
“It was just a buncha moronic half-wits who got together at
the gym, right? I didn’t even need to go see it to know that,” said
Ryuuen.
He had come here looking for students who didn’t go to the
meet-and-greet, just like Horikita had been planning to do. Judging
from the way he was talking, it was clear he was after the top-level
first-year students. There had been only about a slight twenty- or
thirty-minute difference in our timing, but…
With that much time, it was possible that he had already
successfully scouted a number of students. We would be able to
check whether each student had settled on a partner at eight
o’clock the next morning.
“Relax. Still haven’t settled on anybody yet,” said Ryuuen.
Not that the other two people with me today would believe
him so easily, though. That is, until the app actually refreshed, and
it showed what partnerships had been finalized or not for Class 2-
C.
“You look like you don’t believe me,” sneered Ryuuen.
“Well, I’m taking everything you say with a grain of salt, at
the very least,” replied Horikita.
“Huh, okay. Looks like you’ve gotten pretty wary of me,
huh?”
“Oh? I can’t recall ever once not being wary of you before
though. Hm?”
“Kukuku! Well, yeah, guess you’ve got a point there,” said
Ryuuen.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_76">
<p>Sudou glared at Ryuuen, perhaps not liking the mocking way
he spoke to Horikita. A normal person would have shrunk back in
fear from that glare alone, but such a direct attack wouldn’t work
on Ryuuen.
“Looks like you’ve hired yourself a bodyguard. But you chose
a dumb one, lady,” sneered Ryuuen.
“What’d you say?” huffed Sudou.
He looked ready to fly off the handle, but Horikita kept him
in line with a gentle wave of her hand.
“Oh, do you need brains to be a bodyguard? Talk about the
pot calling the kettle black, hm?” said Horikita.
She didn’t avert her eyes from Ryuuen as she delivered that
comeback, still holding her hand out to keep Sudou back.
“Are you planning on scaring the first-years? I’m afraid that
taking that kind of attitude with them is going to backfire on you,”
said Horikita.
They would certainly shrink back if they saw Ryuuen strutting
about like he was the cock of the walk.
“I figured if I threatened ’em a little, they’d immediately
agree to cooperate,” said Ryuuen.
Horikita had been going tit-for-tat with Ryuuen so far, dishing
back what Ryuuen was giving her. But Ryuuen did the opposite this
time, actually affirming what she had just suggested.
“…You’re kidding, right? Do you really think that’s an
acceptable way of doing things?” asked Horikita.
“Acceptable or not, who friggin’ cares. What’s the problem if
someone feels a little threatened? We were told that we couldn’t
force someone to get a lower score or anythin’, but there wasn’t
anythin’ about not using threats to find a partner in the rules,” said
Ryuuen.
“That’s because it should go without saying that it’s not okay,
without it needing to be outlined in the rules. If there is a problem,
you’ll be in trouble,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_77">
<p>“Then show me where the problem is. I ain’t gonna do
somethin’ dumb enough that it’d get traced back to me, anyway,”
said Ryuuen.
He was as bullish and cocksure as ever. Not only was he
saying it was extremely likely that he’d make good on his threats,
but he also stated, quite definitively, that the truth of the matter
would never get out. Whether what he was saying was truth or
falsehood, Horikita, too, must have realized once again that
Ryuuen would always opt to rule with the iron hand of a military
dictator.
“Well, in that case, do whatever you like. But if any evidence
should present itself, I will raise the issue, without question. Or
mercy,” said Horikita.
Her warning was probably meant to serve as a deterrent, but
it didn’t seem to resonate with Ryuuen.
“So? You think you can win anybody over to your class?”
sneered Ryuuen.
Horikita must have determined that there was no need for
her to answer, because she kept her mouth shut.
“You figured somethin’ out when you were snoopin’ around
the meet-and-greet, huh? And then you hurried on over here to
see who was left. That it?” said Ryuuen.
“The same as you then, perhaps?”
“Ku ku. Yeah, maybe.”
Ryuuen continued speaking to Horikita after saying that, as if
all he wanted was to keep things interesting.
“In that case, I’ll tell ya somethin’ good, since we’re on the
same wavelength. This year’s batch of fresh meat are all real calm,
even though they only just started here. Which means there’s a
real good chance that someone from the school is telling these
new kids how things work, to a certain extent,” said Ryuuen.
If that was true, it was quite an unexpected bit of intel. Back
in April, we’d no idea what was going on, and everyone just
messed around as much as they wanted as a result. Of course, the
students from Class A and Class B were more composed, but that</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_78">
<p>could probably be attributed to the significant difference between
our backgrounds.
Also, what Ryuuen was talking about wasn’t just a specific
class. He was referring to the entire grade level. Maybe this was a
measure that had been taken because they had to partner up with
second-year students right at the start of school? Or did the school
have other intentions, perhaps?
“Isn’t it possible that this year’s batch of new students are
just especially quick-witted, and we were just exceptionally slow?”
replied Horikita.
“There’s signs that some of ’em are already coming together,
as a class, right at this stage. That’s way too early.”
Even if they’d immediately started trying to come together as
a class when the special exam was announced, they wouldn’t have
succeeded already. Ryuuen was saying they wouldn’t have come
together like this, now, unless they started the process at an early
stage. Right after they entered the school.
“…What kind of cowardly trick are you trying to pull by telling
me this?” asked Horikita.
“Nothin’, no trick. You can’t just pulverize your opponents in
this special exam. Nothin’ like that. But if you’re gonna win overall,
you’re probably gonna have to pull several strings,” said Ryuuen.
It wasn’t going to be easy to get students from the other
classes expelled in this special exam. The sense of anonymity in it,
of wondering who was going to be partnered with who, was fairly
significant. It was going to be quite difficult to ascertain exactly
who people were partnered with on the app, unless people were
going around making partnerships known publicly or you were very
good at gathering information. Even if you were able to get
classmates who didn’t do so well academically to partner with
students from rival classes, or even if you were to specifically
designate someone for that purpose, it would be almost impossible
to get that student to purposefully cut corners on the test.
If you got a low score—one out of keeping with the level of
academic ability you were supposed to have—it would clearly be
intentional, and then you’d get expelled regardless of what grade</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_79">
<p>level you were in. In the end, the difference between victory and
defeat came down to two things: the abilities of the students in
your own class, and the abilities of the first-year students. In terms
of strategy, what you could do was win as many academically
skilled first-years over to your class as possible.
It wasn’t going to be easy for Class C to come out on top in
this exam, considering their low levels of overall ability. There was
no way they could hope to compete with Class A financially, and
the academic skills of the two classes were on entirely different
levels. No matter how much money they threw at the first-years to
try and poach them, the results weren’t going to be pretty. In that
case, they should abandon the idea of trying to win first place
overall and aim instead for the individual competition, with rewards
given to the top thirty percent.
Of course, Horikita didn’t make any mention of that. Because
it would be a problem for us if Class A and Class C weren’t trying
to duke it out with each other for overall points. Rather than let
Class A easily snatch the top spot, I was hoping A and C would
fight it out on a grand scale, so they’d wear each other down, if
only a little.
“Try your best to keep up,” chided Ryuuen.
“I suppose I could say the same to you. Your concerns are
completely unnecessary,” said Horikita.
“Ku ku. Well, my bad.”
Then Ryuuen immediately left, vacating the first-year
students’ floor. He had been here too short a time to have finished
what needed doing.
“The first-years might resist us much more strongly than I
thought they would,” said Horikita.
If they were aware of the fact that they were basically locked
in a desperate struggle to the death with the other classes at this
school, then yes, I supposed it was only natural they’d be hesitant
to negotiate with us.
“In that case, shouldn’t we try and negotiate with ’em at
least a little, as soon as we can?” said Sudou.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_80">
<p>“Yes… Of course we should. But…”
Horikita directed her gaze towards the end of the hall. She
was looking at where the classroom for Class 1-D was.
“Let’s get goin’,” said Sudou.
“I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Horikita.
Apparently, Horikita had noticed it too while she was talking
with Ryuuen. The entire time they talked, from when Ryuuen
strolled out of the classroom to when he left, not a single student
had been seen leaving the classroom. And we didn’t hear a single
sound as we approached the room, either.
When we eventually reached the door to the classroom and
opened it, our suspicions were confirmed.
“D-dude, what the hell’s goin’ on?!” yelled Sudou in a panic,
as he scanned the inside of the classroom from end to end.
“Negotiating with Class 1-D might be much, much more
difficult than I expected,” said Horikita.
The classroom was completely empty. There wasn’t a single
person in sight. The forty students, who hadn’t shown up to the
meet-and-greet either, seemed to have suddenly disappeared
without a trace.
“This class might be more trouble than I had thought,” she
added.
However, it wasn’t like we could just sit here and wallow in
our anxiety. We needed to take action before the other classes
really started making their moves in earnest. The competition was
starting tomorrow. Horikita’s battle was going to begin the moment
that she contacted Class 1-D. As for me, I was going to head back
to my dorm and memorize all the names and faces of the new
students in the OAA app. Horikita had her battle to fight, and I had
mine.
And as it turned out, on the day the special exam was
announced, a total of twenty-two partnerships had been finalized.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_81">
<p>4.2
 
THE SITUATION TOOK A SUDDEN, unexpected turn near the end of
our lunch break on the next day. Something happened after we
had finished eating our lunches, while we sat in our classroom,
casually waiting for our afternoon classes to begin.
“H-hey! Dudes! Some first-years are headed this way!”
shouted one of my classmates, Miyamoto.
This special exam depended on first- and second-year
students working together. You’d think this wouldn’t be such a
surprising development, but apparently, that wasn’t the case.
“Wow, they must be awfully brave to come up to the
upperclassmen’s floor,” said Yousuke, while I mulled things over in
my head. “I mean, if we decided to head up to the third-year’s
floor, we’d have to be very careful not to make a fuss.”
“Yeah, that’s true…”
It would be a different story if you had a lot of close
friendships with your senpai, but for this year’s batch of new
students, that wasn’t the case. Many of them must have felt like
they were venturing into enemy territory. I supposed that in that
sense, some of them showing up like this might actually be an
event that merited surprise.
Yousuke said he was going to go check it out, so I followed
him, heading out into the hallway. Horikita and Sudou followed
right after us.
The first thing that caught my eye was a guy with a
particularly large build. There were several reasons why he stood
out, one of which was that he seemed to be around Sudou’s
height. But, more than that, it was the strong impression he made
as he walked confidently down the center of the hall on our floor.
The other second-year students in the hall avoided him, walking at
the edges of the hallway. Which seemed like the opposite of what
you’d normally expect.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_82">
<p>Following a little way behind this student was a girl. Horikita,
realizing that they weren’t simply here looking for partners,
stepped out in front of the male student to block his path. Sudou
stuck close to her.
When Horikita and Sudou came face-to-face with these new
students, the first-year student made eye contact with me for
some reason, even though I was watching from some distance
away. Shortly afterward, he looked away from me and shifted his
gaze to Horikita. I pulled up the data I had learned from the OAA
yesterday in my memory. It seemed Horikita was about to make
rather unexpected contact with that class.
“Who’s this chick?” asked the guy.
“Please wait a moment… I’ve found it,” said the girl.
After fiddling with her phone for a short while, she showed
him her screen.
“Class 2-D. Horikita Suzune. Academic ability A-, huh?” said
the guy, gruffly.
The girl spoke in a rather polite tone of voice, unlike the guy,
which made them seem like quite the odd combination. They then
directed their gazes over at Sudou, who was standing beside
Horikita. And just like before, the girl showed the guy her phone
screen.
“Sudou Ken… Heh.” After looking at Sudou’s data, the guy let
out a mocking snort.
“Hello, my name is Nanase, from Class 1-D. He’s from the
same class. This is—”
“Housen,” he said, interrupting her.
They both gave us their last names. Just for reference, the
large guy’s full name was Housen Kazuomi and the girl’s was
Nanase Tsubasa. They were both genuine Class 1-D students, just
as they had said they were. Students from the very same that we’d
tried to meet with yesterday, but couldn’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_83">
<img src="https://cote12.ct.ws/11.jpg">
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_84">
<p>Although their sudden arrival here was rather unexpected, it
was both a lucky break and a stroke of ill fortune for Horikita. That
was because we couldn’t exactly start negotiating with Class 1-D
out in the open, while under the watchful eyes of the other
classes.
“For a couple of new students, you’ve done something quite
brave. I admire your pluck,” said Horikita.
“Huh? What, you admire our pluck? Don’t act so high and
mighty, woman,” snapped Housen.
“She ain’t bein’ high and mighty, dude. Don’t get all full of
yourself, kid,” shouted Sudou.
Housen had snapped at Horikita, causing Sudou to snap back
at him in turn. Even though they were about the same height,
Housen had a slightly bigger build, making Sudou look a bit
smaller in comparison.
“Dude, your score’s an E+. Guess you’re just as much of a
moron as you look,” said Housen.
“What was that?!” shouted Sudou.
“Well, whatever, this is fine. Looks like this place is crawling
with Class D rejects anyway. Works for me.”
“What is that supposed to mean?” asked Horikita.
“As I said, you Class D punks are all just a bunch of rejects,
leftovers. You can’t even form pairs unless we pick you. So I
figured, hey, I’ll lend you incompetent, braindead morons a hand.
You get what I’m sayin’?” said Housen.
It was almost as if he was testing Horikita.
“Meaning you want us to team up with you. And you’re
making your request with a rather condescending attitude,” she
replied.
“Uh, yeah? I mean, you’re the ones who should be beggin’
us to team up with you. Hell, I even dragged myself all the way
out here,” Housen snapped back at Horikita, basically implying we
weren’t in remotely the same position. “Come on. Go ahead and
beg. Say, ‘Please, please team up with us,’ and start bowin’.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_85">
<p>Horikita, still holding Sudou back to keep him from losing his
temper, argued back at him, her words growing in intensity despite
the difference in size between her and Housen. “You seem to be
misunderstanding something. Our positions are equal.”
“Equal? Your idiot friend over there oughta be the only one
spewing bullshit like that,” said Housen.
“You’re in Class D, just like us. There’s no difference between
us,” said Horikita.
“You don’t get it. There are plenty of things we can do to you
if we feel like it. Get it? I mean, you don’t want trouble, right?
Then you should know your place and start beggin’.”
Apparently, this Housen person had already noticed that the
first-years had a secret weapon they could use to their advantage.
“And just what are these things you could do to us?” asked
Horikita. She likely already knew the answer, but deliberately asked
anyway, to make Housen come out and say it.
“Come on, you know, dontcha? What I’m sayin’ is that we
can get bad test scores, on purpose,” said Housen.
When Horikita heard him say that, she bit her lip with some
force.
“Huh?! Enough already, you little first-year punk! You mess
up the test, and you’ll get kicked outta school!” shouted Sudou.
“Stop. Don’t be so quick to lose your cool, Sudou-kun. That’s
a bad habit of yours,” said Horikita.
“But…”
I could understand why Sudou would want to vent his anger
after hearing Housen talk to Horikita like that. However, what
Housen was saying wasn’t a lie.
“Yeah, it’s true that if you mess up on the test on purpose,
you get expelled. But the penalty for not bein’ able to find a
partner before time’s up is different. That only applies to you guys,
right?” said Housen.
The rules stated that if you ran out of time before you found
a partner, one would be randomly assigned to you. On top of that,</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_86">
<p>if you ran out of time, it would result in a 5 percent penalty taken
off your overall score. And the second-year students, who could
face expulsion, would take more damage from that penalty.
“I-is that really true?!” shouted Sudou, incredulous.
He shot Horikita a pleading look, seeking confirmation on
whether what Housen said was true. The only answer she could
possibly give him was ‘yes.’
“Wouldn’t you be putting a noose around your own neck by
doing that, though? Do you really intend on taking a loss
immediately after you’ve started school?” asked Horikita.
If you got hit with a penalty, your chances of getting five
hundred and one points or more on the test would naturally
plummet.
“Well, compared to you guys, can’t say we’d get hurt all that
bad. Ain’t that right?” sneered Housen. He looked to the girl
standing behind him, Nanase, for confirmation.
“Yes, that’s correct. We wouldn’t have any Private Points
deposited into our account for three months, but that would still
only be a maximum of two hundred forty thousand points. I don’t
think it would be a fatal setback,” replied Nanase.
“Get the picture now, Horikita-senpai?”
Housen regarded Horikita as though he were superior to her,
even though she was his senior. Sudou, seeing him treat her that
way, must have lost his patience. He stood in front of Horikita now,
exuding intimidation, though he still wasn’t throwing any punches.
“You wanna go?” said Housen, without any hesitation
whatsoever.
“Don’t get too full of yourself, punk,” huffed Sudou.
“Don’t lose your cool, Sudou-kun. You do understand how
things work at this school, don’t you?” said Horikita.
It wasn’t unreasonable for the new students not to know
this, but the hallways were supervised quite closely by school
officials. The surveillance cameras were constantly monitoring us,</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_87">
<p>so if there was a problem, the school officials could go dig up the
footage.
“I know…” said Sudou.
After having been repeatedly admonished by Horikita, Sudou
backed off, though he looked irritated. It was certainly a problem
that he got riled up so easily, but I supposed the fact that all it
took was a word from Horikita to keep him in check was a relief.
Just then, as Sudou’s attention was focused on Horikita,
Housen thrust his large hand forward against Sudou’s chest and
shoved him.
“Wha-?!”
In the next instant, Sudou lost his balance, falling backward,
landing on his hands.
“Ha, only thing big about you is your height, loser. Just a
little tap was all it took?” sneered Housen.
What Housen just did was so reckless that even the other
second-year students watching the situation couldn’t hide their
unease. Considering how dramatic the action had been, it wouldn’t
have been surprising for it to be seen as an act of violence. If you
understood how difficult and risky it was to try and do something
violent in this school, you couldn’t do it.
We’d thought this year’s batch of new students were more
familiar with how things worked at this school than students from
previous years. If the information we had gotten from Ryuuen the
other day was true, then I had to say what Housen had just done
was quite reckless.
Maybe they actually didn’t understand the school as well as
we thought they did? No, it didn’t seem like that was the case. If
so, then…
“Asshole!”
Sudou, having regained his composure and realized what had
just been done to him, looked ready to let all his pent-up anger
explode at once. But right before that happened, another guy, who
had been watching the situation from afar, jumped in.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_88">
<p>“Dude, the hell are you doin’?!”
It was Ishizaki Daiichi from Class 2-C. He was quick to lose
his temper and could be easily categorized as a delinquent, but he
was also a compassionate person. It seemed like he’d run out of
patience after seeing Sudou, someone from his grade level, being
treated with such cruelty.
“Man, these losers just keep poppin’ up outta nowhere, one
after another. Like cockroaches,” said Housen with a smirk, as if he
found the situation amusing.
The girl who had introduced herself earlier as Nanase moved
to rein him back in.
“Housen-kun, I thought we came here to have a discussion?
If we came here just so you could get violent, then I’ll be leaving,”
said Nanase.
“Violent? All I did was touch the guy, like I was pettin’ a cat
or somethin’. Well, sorry, my bad, Sudou,” said Housen,
purposefully addressing Sudou without an honorific, as if he were
spitting on him.
“Hey, man, you’re goin’ too far! Knock that crap off!” shouted
Ishizaki, reaching out to grab Housen by his collar.
The moment that Housen saw Ishizaki’s arm reaching for
him, though, the corners of his mouth curved up slightly into a
smirk.
“Better think twice, Ishizaki, unless you wanna die,” someone
warned.
Ishizaki stopped just before he took hold of Housen’s collar.
The warning had come from none other than Ryuuen, who had
also been standing by, watching.
“Wh-why’d you stop me?!” huffed Ishizaki. He seemed visibly
confused by the fact that Ryuuen had stopped him.
Ibuki, a classmate of theirs, was also surprised by what
Ryuuen had just done. “What do you think you’re doing? By
stopping him, I mean?” she asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_89">
<p>Ryuuen generally welcomed fights. He was the furthest
possible thing from a person who hated trouble. He didn’t care if
there were security cameras around or not; when he wanted to
throw down, he did so without hesitation. Which was precisely why
it was so surprising to see him stop a fight from happening.
Ryuuen ordered Ishizaki back and then approached Housen
himself.
“So, what, you’re supposed to be my opponent now? Dude,
you look weak compared to that moron Sudou over there,” said
Housen mockingly, after getting a look at Ryuuen.
Ryuuen certainly wasn’t a big and brawny guy. I supposed
that was why Housen considered him weak.
“I know you pretty well, yeah. I remember hearin’ that this
Housen dude was a bit of a celebrity in my hometown. I never
imagined he’d look like such a total braindead idiot, though,”
replied Ryuuen.
Housen repeatedly hurled insults at Sudou over and over,
calling him stupid, so Ryuuen threw the same insult right back in
his face. Something that was honestly quite typical of Ryuuen.
Normally, Ryuuen was an enemy to every class that wasn’t his
own, but it was heartening to see him stand up to Housen like this.
In fact, Sudou had successfully managed to bottle up his anger
thanks to the change in atmosphere.
“Y-you know this dude, Ryuuen-san?” asked Ishizaki.
“Wait. Ryuuen, you say?”
When Housen heard Ryuuen’s name, the look on his face
changed. And then his wide mouth cracked open into an amused
smile.
“Hey now, ain’t this somethin’? This has gotta be fate.
Honestly, I’ve heard your name get thrown around so much that
it’s been pissin’ me off, Ryuuen,” said Housen.
“Wow, so you’ve got the brain cells to actually remember
someone’s name?” replied Ryuuen.
Apparently, these two had known about each other for some
time now. It seemed like Housen, from Class 1-D, came from</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_90">
<p>somewhere close to Ryuuen’s hometown.
That said, looking at the relationship between Ryuuen and
Ishizaki and Ibuki, it seemed safe to say that Ryuuen had made a
full comeback. He had temporarily stepped down from his position,
but he was beginning to take command of his class once again.
“Gotta say though, for the fabled Ryuuen to look all scrawny
and pitiful… Damn, that’s a shame,” said Housen.
“Meanwhile you look like just as much of a musclebound
freak as I imagined,” sneered Ryuuen.
“Y’know, I swung around your old hangouts a couple of
times because I was plannin’ to beat the everlovin’ shit out of you.
But I guess the reason I never ran into you was because you were
terrified of me and hid, huh? What, you’ve been runnin’ away and
making your little soldiers do all the work? Is that it?” said Housen.
“Ku ku. I’d say it’s more like lady luck saved your ass,
Housen. If you had met me back then, you certainly wouldn’t be
acting like such a bigshot right now. I guess you really lucked out,
’cause you can say you haven’t lost to me yet,” said Ryuuen.
“Actually, I think you just ran with your tail between your
legs. If you’re tryin’ to tell me that’s not how it is, then how about
we settle things, right here and now?”
Housen formed his giant hand into a fist, looking confident.
If he knew who Ryuuen was in junior high, the impression he had
of Ryuuen shouldn’t be all that different from the impression we
had of Ryuuen. Perhaps he didn’t see Ryuuen as someone that you
want as an enemy?
“Yeah, hard pass. I ain’t plannin’ on fighting a gorilla like you
when there’s nothing in it for me,” said Ryuuen.
Even though Housen was fixing for a fight, Ryuuen turned
his offer down. Of course, that was because there was no way that
he could actually fight in a place like this, but… I was sure Ishizaki
and Ibuki had thought Ryuuen would accept the offer, even if that
meant they had to take the fight elsewhere.
“Wait, is this dude all that dangerous? I mean, sure, he’s
bigger than Sudou and all, but…” said Ishizaki.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_91">
<p>“Who can say?” Ryuuen seemed to have no intention of
giving a straight answer to that question. Then he issued an order
to his subordinates, a smirk on his face. “Let’s go.”
“Are you really okay with letting a first-year disrespect you
like this?” asked Ibuki.
She was aware of the fact that it was in Ryuuen’s nature to
throw down against anyone, no matter who it was. That was why
she couldn’t help but ask him that question.
“Heh. We can settle things whenever. What’s the rush?”
replied Ryuuen, quietly and calmly.
While it would have been fine had things ended right there,
Housen started walking forward, closing the distance between
himself and Ryuuen.
“Is that chick one of your little soldiers too?” asked Housen,
after having watched them bicker earlier.
“Yeah, somethin’ like that,” said Ryuuen.
“Huh? What are you talking about? Don’t go and act like
you’re the boss of me,” snapped Ibuki.
“So you even stoop to using chicks as soldiers, huh,
Ryuuen?” asked Housen.
“Could say the same to you, buddy. You’re the one who
brought that cute little thing over there, right?” said Ryuuen.
Just like how Ryuuen was accompanied by Ibuki, Housen had
Nanase standing beside him.
“She ain’t mine. Well, whatever, I couldn’t care less about
that. Let’s have some fun, Ryuuen,” said Housen.
“Already told ya. Hard pass.”
No matter how many times Housen tried to provoke Ryuuen
into fighting, Ryuuen wouldn’t budge. As if to signal his disinterest,
Ryuuen turned his back on Housen, showing that he’d made his
mind up about withdrawing.
“Huh, that so? In that case…”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_92">
<p>Housen must have decided Ryuuen’s failure to take the bait
was no fun, because he suddenly extended his arm in a smooth,
casual movement. He reached out for Ibuki. She tried to brush him
off.
However…
Just as she tried to brush him off, he quickly accelerated the
force behind the movement, grabbing Ibuki by the neck and
raising her up into the air.
“Ngh?!”
Ibuki hurriedly tried to free herself from his grip, as if a
distress signal were being transmitted from her brain to the rest of
her body in that instant. However, Housen merely flashed an
audacious grin, not giving an inch, as if his arms were made of
steel.
Ryuuen turned back around and saw Ibuki being choked out
by Housen. She tried to break free of his grip, deftly using her
arms and legs, but Housen still didn’t budge.
“Hah. Just try and slip outta that. Or, all of you watchin’ can
jump in and get a piece of me too,” said Housen.
Judging by the look on Housen’s face, it wasn’t that he was
fearless—but rather, that he possessed a kind of absolute
confidence. However, I was certain this wasn’t the kind of situation
where I could step into the ring myself. If I made a scene right
here and now, the school would naturally get wind of it and
inevitably show up to put a stop to the situation.
The only one who wasn’t tied down by such concerns—
Ryuuen—was the one who made a move, though he looked rather
exasperated about it. Probably moving to save Ibuki rather than
strike a blow against Housen, he moved forward, slipping into the
space between Ibuki and Housen, near his chest. However, Housen
still kept his grip tight on Ibuki’s neck. And even in this situation,
where his movement was limited, he continued to sidestep
Ryuuen’s repeated kicks.
“Asshole!” shouted Ishizaki.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_93">
<p>Ishizaki, who had been told to stand down before, now
jumped into the fray. A commotion was starting to erupt, the likes
of which you could never imagine happening in the hallways here
at school.
“Yeah, yeah! Man, am I glad I came all the way to this
school,” said Housen.
A genuine, no-holds-barred fight might actually start any
second now. Amid all this, Nanase, who had been watching the
situation from the onset, opened her mouth to speak.
“Please stop, Housen-kun.”
Despite the handicap of still having Ibuki in his grasp,
Housen looked ready to start brawling with Ryuuen and Ishizaki as
they barreled down on him. But he stopped moving after his
classmate Nanase called out to him.
“What’d you just say?” he asked.
Rather than heed her warning, he looked irritated by the fact
that she had spoken up and butted in.
“The upperclassmen have all been concerned about the fact
that there are surveillance cameras around here for a while now.
Judging from the situation, I’ve determined there’s nothing to be
gained by getting violent here,” said Nanase.
“Yeah, I know. I know already, I was just messin’ around
with ’em,” said Housen, before adding that he knew all along that
we second-years were tied down because of the surveillance
cameras.
If that was the case, everything Housen had just done after
showing up here really was quite puzzling.
He ignored Nanase’s warning, looking as though he was
about to resume fighting, so she spoke up once more, in a firmer
tone than before.
“If you do understand, then that’s all the more reason you
should stop. If you’re going to try to waste more time here, then I
have an idea of my own. I’m considering bringing that up and
telling everyone here about it,” said Nanase.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_94">
<p>After Housen heard her mention that, whatever abstract idea
it was supposed to represent, he stopped moving once again.
Then, with a look of total boredom on his face, he let go of Ibuki
and dropped her to the floor, where she coughed and hacked.
“Hey, not bad, Nanase. But just know that if you don’t live up
to my expectations, I won’t show you any mercy. Even if you’re a
girl. Got it?” said Housen.
“When that time comes, I’ll take whatever comes my way,”
said Nanase.
Even though Housen had just threatened her, Nanase didn’t
sound upset. She seemed so calm that it was like it didn’t matter
one bit to her that she was currently standing on the second-years’
floor.
Even so, this Housen guy was certainly no pushover. There
was no shortage of people in my grade level who could boast of
their fighting prowess. Among the guys, that included Ryuuen,
Sudou, and Albert. Even though Housen was a first-year, just this
brief glimpse of him in action told me he was quite capable
himself. He probably wouldn’t be the kind of opponent I could
subdue all that easily, if I were to face off against him. And
because I had only gotten a glimpse of him in action, I couldn’t
predict how things would go if he really went all out. Ryuuen had
probably tried to stop Ishizaki from casually throwing down against
Housen because he determined that engaging in a simple fistfight
would put them at a disadvantage.
This was one hell of a new student we were dealing with.
“All right, I’ll stop. My business is all taken care of. Let’s go,
Nanase,” said Housen.
“That is a wise choice,” replied Nanase.
Housen, seemingly satisfied with everything else except for
the lack of a fight, shot one last look at Ryuuen.
“If you get down on your knees for me, I don’t mind pairin’
up with ya. Whaddya say, Ryuuen-paisen?”
“Sorry, dude, but I only work with human beings. Can’t say I
got any plans of teamin’ up with a wild gorilla.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_95">
<p>“Oh, well, that’s too bad,” said Housen.
However, this whole ordeal wasn’t over yet. Aside from
Housen and Nanase, there was one other first-year present who
had been observing the entire situation. Perhaps Housen was
upset with this other student, because he turned his attention to
him at the end.
“Hey, you just gonna hide and watch, punk?” sneered
Housen.
“Do you know the proverb ‘a wide man keeps away from
danger’?” replied the student, fending off Housen’s glare with an
eloquent response. “Making friendly conversation is fine, but it
wouldn’t be beneficial for you to cause a ruckus here, Housen-kun.
At any rate, I think you ought to withdraw for the time being. Am I
wrong?”
At the same time, the boy gave Housen what could be
interpreted as friendly advice, an adult showed, too.
“What are you doing, Housen?” he asked.
This lone man, clad in a suit, seemed to have appeared out
of nowhere, as if to put a stop to all this tumultuous situation.
Many of the second-years who had been standing by and watching
the situation unfold had fled, returning to their own classrooms.
“Housen, I understand you’re restless. But I’m also quite
sure the school rules have been drilled so thoroughly into your
head by now that it feels ready to explode,” said the adult.
“Yeah, yeah, I know,” said Housen.
“If you do understand, then hurry up and disperse.
No fighting in the hallways.”
“That was hardly even a real fight, though,” snorted Housen.
With a scornful chuckle, he thrust his hands into his pockets,
and then turned around, making an unexpectedly easy decision to
retreat. He then ordered Nanase to retreat as well.
“Well, see you later, Horikita.”
Housen purposefully dropped Horikita’s name before he left…
Well, no. It might be more accurate to say he was addressing the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_96">
<p>whole of Class 2-D.
“We apologize for the disturbance,” said Nanase, with a bow
of her head.
With that apology, the situation seemed to have been more
or less successfully contained. But, when Nanase lifted her head
back up, she looked me right in the eyes right as she was leaving.
It was the same look she’d given me when she first arrived on this
floor. A probing look, almost as if she wanted to know something.
However, as soon as I noticed her looking at me, she
immediately averted her eyes, and chased after Housen.
“I must apologize to you all. I’m terribly sorry. My students
have caused you quite a bit of trouble,” the teacher apologized to
Horikita as she stood by watching everything that happened.
“No, it’s all right…” she replied.
“Since we’re here, please allow me to briefly introduce
myself. I am Shiba Katsunori and I will be overseeing Class 1-D.
I’ve only just accepted a position here at this school. I look forward
to getting to know you all,” said the teacher.
After giving us that brief self-introduction, Shiba-sensei left,
following at Housen. Then, almost as if they were taking turns, the
level-headed boy from earlier came up and bowed his head to us.
“It would seem that my classmate Housen-kun has caused a
great deal of trouble for you, our seniors. On behalf of the first-
year students, I’d like to offer my humble apologies,” said the boy.
Unlike Housen, he seemed to be quite a well-spoken student.
“We first-year students still don’t understand these special
exams very well. I apologize for the inconvenience this may cause
you, but we would humbly appreciate any help. Thank you,” said
the student.
After he had finished giving us his apologies and general
salutations, the student, who was apparently named Yagami,
looked as though he was about to leave himself. But then he
seemed to notice something—a group of four girls from Class D
who’d just returned from lunch. Matsushita, Kushida, Satou, and
Mii-chan.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_97">
<p>Yagami looked at one member of the group, Kushida, with
surprise on his face.
“It seems there’s been quite a fuss. What happened,
Horikita-san?” Though Kushida was clearly aware of Yagami’s
presence in turn, she asked Horikita about what was going on,
sounding quite curious.
“Nothing that you all need to worry about,” said Horikita.
“Oh, really?”
After Horikita told them that it was nothing, Kushida and the
other three girls started to head back towards the classroom.
“Um, pardon me, but…you wouldn’t happen to be Kushida-
senpai, by any chance, would you?” asked Yagami.
“Hm?” replied Kushida, turning around to look at who’d
addressed her.
If he knew Kushida’s name, could he be an acquaintance of
hers? Or so I thought, but…
“Um, you are?” said Kushida.
She gave him a puzzled look. There was no sign that she was
familiar with him.
“It’s me. Do you not recognize me? Well, I suppose that’s
only natural that you wouldn’t. It’s Yagami Takuya,” he replied.
Kushida thought on it for a while after hearing his name, but
then seemed to suddenly remember. “Yagami… Ah! Wait! You’re
that Yagami-kun?!”
“Yes, I am most certainly that Yagami. It’s been quite a long
time, hasn’t it?”
“Wow, so you came to this school too, Yagami-kun. What an
incredible coincidence!”
“I never imagined I’d meet you again here, Kushida-senpai.”
“You know each other?” asked Satou, curiously.
Kushida nodded. “Yes. But we hardly ever actually talked
before. Anyway, his name is Yagami Takuya-kun. He always</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_98">
<p>seemed incredibly smart. but since we were in different grades, we
never said much more than hello to each other.”
“So, do you know him too?” I asked, whispering in Horikita’s
ear to get confirmation.
“Nope, I don’t know him at all,” she replied immediately.
“Well, you don’t seem very good at remembering the faces of
your classmates, though.”
“I won’t deny that. I didn’t exactly have time to pay attention
to people I wasn’t interested in,” said Horikita.
Apparently, Horikita didn’t recognize…no, it was more like he
didn’t register in her mind at all. I supposed if you were the kind of
person who treated your classmates that way, there was no way
you’d remember students younger than you.
Well, even if Kushida didn’t remember this boy, he’d probably
never been able to forget her. It just went to show how captivating
she was.
“I can’t believe how lucky I am. To be able to go to the same
school as the revered Kushida-senpai…” said Yagami.
“Oh, no, that’s a bit much, I’m nothing special…” she replied
humbly.
However, if Yagami really had attended the same junior high
as Kushida, then a few concerns came to mind.
“Does this Yagami kid know about you know what?”
I whispered to Horikita.
I was referring to Kushida’s past, of course. In junior high,
Kushida had caused her own class to turn on itself and fall apart.
As a result, she considered Horikita—who’d attended the same
school back then and knew the truth about what happened—a
bitter enemy. Kushida wanted to get rid of Horikita, considering it
too dangerous for someone to know what she’d done to her class.
If Yagami had attended the same junior high, it wouldn’t be
a surprise if he knew about what happened, too, but…
“It wouldn’t be strange if he did. That being said, there’s no
guarantee that he does,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_99">
<p>In that case, Yagami being here certainly wasn’t very
comforting for Kushida. Since there were students in our grade
level who’d attended the same schools before, I supposed it wasn’t
out of the question for students’ former juniors to enroll, either.
“I realize this is quite sudden, but I must say I would have
neither complaints nor concerns if I were able to team up with
someone like you, Kushida-senpai. Would you be willing to partner
with me?” asked Yagami.
Even though he and Kushida had only just been reunited, he
asked to become partners, extending his hand with a friendly smile
on his face. Was this all to show that he knew nothing about her
past? Or that even if he did know, it didn’t matter?</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_100">
<img src="https://cote12.ct.ws/12.jpg">
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_101">
<p>“Are you really okay with partnering with me, though? I
mean, Yagami-kun, perhaps it would be better if you partnered
with someone more on your level academically?” said Kushida.
Yagami Takuya had an extremely high academic ability rating
of A. Nothing to scoff at. No wonder Kushida was being so humble.
Horikita, who had her phone out, looked up his information in the
OAA app while she stood next to me, and confirmed that he was
high-ranked.
“I don’t know my way around here at all. So, I’d like to
partner with someone I trust,” said Yagami.
The app could give you an idea of a person’s academic
ability, but not their nature. He must have decided it would be
better to team up with an acquaintance who he could be sure
would produce solid results.
“Um, well, could you give me some time to think it over…?”
Perhaps because she was wary of Yagami, or for some other
reason, Kushida put his offer on hold for the time being.
“Of course, that would be perfectly fine. I will hold off on
partnering up with anyone else for a while, and await your reply,
Kushida-senpai.” Yagami agreed to put the offer on hold, indicating
he was fine to wait. Considering that his academic ability was A-
rank, there was no need for him to rush out and find a partner.
“Damn, that must be nice. If it were me, I would’ve
partnered up without a second thought…” Sudou seemed jealous
of Kushida’s ability to put an offer on hold. That made sense,
considering his ranking was only E+.
“In that case, you should work harder,” said Horikita.
“Yeah… I’ll definitely improve my scores,” he answered.
It wasn’t a mean-spirited comment. Sudou was envious
because he had a desire to improve himself.
I distanced myself from Horikita and the others for a moment
because I saw Haruka beckoning me to come over. The rest of
Ayanokouji Group all stood a short distance away: Akito, Keisei,
and Airi.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_102">
<p>“H-he was super scary, wasn’t he?”
The first thing I heard after joining them was Airi’s first
impression of Housen.
“Sure seems there’s a bunch of troublemakers like Sudou-kun
and Ryuuen-kun in this year’s batch of new students, huh?”
Haruka sounded somewhat exasperated after having watched the
entire commotion play out.
Standing beside her was Akito. He remained motionless,
staring fixedly at the spot in the hall where Housen once stood.
“What’s the matter, Miyacchi?” asked Haruka.
“A seriously scary dude has come to our school. Let’s just say
things are probably gonna get rocky from here on out. That
dude’s… Well, he’s so tough that even Sudou or Ryuuen can’t take
him on,” said Akito.
“Wait, hold up. Don’t tell me you know this guy too, Miyachi.
Do you?” asked Haruka.
“I never, like, met him in person or anythin’. But Ryuuen and
Housen are both pretty big celebrities back where I’m from,” said
Akito.
It seemed Akito had lived somewhere close to the junior high
schools that Ryuuen and Housen had attended.
“Anyway, there used to be this gang leader at my school…
The short version of the story is that this guy was a really tough-
looking badass who was supposed to be really good in a fight. But
one day, he just suddenly vanished. It caused a huge uproar. Then,
right after he disappeared, I heard he’d wound up in the hospital
after getting the crap beaten out of him in a one-on-one fight with
some dude named Housen, who was on a rampage. This Housen
had apparently just started at our junior high. He was a whole two
years younger than the other guy.”
“G-gang leader? Dang, that’s like somethin’ straight out of a
manga about bad dudes… That’s a little scary,” said Haruka.
“The place I used to live in has been pretty infamous for
attracting all sorts of riff raff for a long time now,” said Akito.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_103">
<p>“Oh, wow…” Haruka looked a little bit perplexed to hear this
string of unfamiliar words from Akito.
“And just like that, Housen went around all the junior high
schools in the area, one after another, tightening his grip on all of
’em,” said Akito.
“Ryuuen-kun’s pretty infamous too, isn’t he? But it seems like
they’ve never met before,” said Haruka.
“I get the feeling that’s ’cause they just never happened to
run into each other,” said Akito.
“By the way, did you used to be a bad dude yourself,
Miyachi?” asked Haruka.
“I… I quit doing that kinda stuff. These days I’m tryin’ to be
a proper student.”
“So, you were a delinquent.”
“…I had a bad temper all the way up into my second-year of
junior high. Since then, I’ve focused everything into archery,” said
Akito.
“But that means you really used to be a bad kid, though,
right?” asked Haruka.
Akito scratched his head in annoyance as Haruka, strangely
enough, continued to press the matter.
“So? What’s wrong with that?” he shot back.
“No, actually, like…I think it’s kinda fine? If anything, I think
that means you’ve got a pretty cool past. Don’t ya think?” said
Haruka.
“It ain’t cool at all,” said Akito.
I was guessing the reason he knew so much about fighting
was because he used to be that sort of person. You could certainly
tell by looking at him that he had nerves of steel and quick
reflexes.
“I mean, since you were a former bad kid yourself, couldn’t
you just give Housen a taste of his own medicine if necessary?”
asked Haruka.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_104">
<p>“Quit jokin’ around. Even if I do fight somebody, I choose my
opponents carefully. And I especially wouldn’t wanna fight Housen,
for sure,” said Akito.
Akito was raising the white flag before the fight even
happened. He was saying that less as an admission of his own
weakness, though, and more due to recognizing Housen’s
strength. Ibuki also had a certain degree of proficiency when it
came to hand-to-hand combat, and she hadn’t been able to land a
single hit. There was just an overwhelming difference in their
physiques. And she wasn’t a match for him when it came to speed
either.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_105">
<p>4.3
 
AFTER CLASS ENDED, I was approached by Horikita, just like
yesterday. As we were about to leave the classroom together,
Sudou insisted on accompanying us as well. Horikita tried to refuse
him, but just like last time, she seemed to be won over by his
eagerness to help until he found a partner of his own. She let him
come along on the condition that him taking time to help her
wouldn’t interfere with his club activities or his studies. It was
certainly surprising for Horikita to be so kind, or perhaps I should
say accepting.
But I supposed there was a good reason for her allowing him
to come. There were about ten days left until the special exam.
Considering how exceptionally difficult the written exam was going
to be, it was a good idea to secure a time and place where you’d
be able to concentrate on your studies, even if just for a little
while. But if Sudou was constantly worrying about what Horikita
was up to, he wouldn’t be able to concentrate.
It was clear to see that Horikita wanted to find a partner for
Sudou as soon as possible, so that he could have time to devote
himself to his studies. Horikita understood Sudou Ken very well—
except for one particularly important thing. Namely, Sudou’s
feelings for Horikita. She hadn’t recognized that there was a
reason, deep down, why he just wanted to be by her side.
Of course, I wasn’t going to deliberately point out what was
an important driving force for Sudou.
Instead of heading toward the first-year classrooms, Horikita
decided to head towards Keyaki Mall, perhaps because some first-
years had caused quite a bit of trouble after coming up to our floor
today during lunch. She was being careful to ensure a comparable
incident didn’t take place.
Or maybe it was the problem child Housen, from Class 1-D,
who had caused Horikita to change her mind. I supposed we’d find
out soon enough. As soon as we entered the mall, Sudou stuck the
little finger of his left hand in his ear to try and block out some of</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_106">
<p>the sound, seeming a little irritated by the noise. He then gave his
honest thoughts on the new students we saw out and about in
front of us.
“Man, I gotta say it’s loud in here, dude. Guess that’s ’cause
of the first-years kickin’ up a ruckus and all.”
“There certainly are quite a lot of students around,” replied
Horikita.
They were all over the place, chatting away happily,
discussing things like what they wanted to buy or what they
wanted to eat.
“And yet we’re all seriously lookin’ for partners over here,”
huffed Sudou.
Wasting day after day trying to decide on a partner wasn’t
good for either the second-years or the first-years. However, there
was one particularly huge point of separation between the first-
and second-years. That was the difference in our perception of the
special exams. Very few of the new students felt a keen sense of
urgency, just like the ones we’d seen yesterday after class. This
fact was even more apparent when we set foot outside the school
building.
“It’s no wonder. I mean, it was the same for us, back when
we were the new kids,” I replied.
“Yeah, that’s true…” said Sudou.
With the hefty sum of money deposited into their accounts
right after they had enrolled here, the new students were spending
day after day in pursuit of idle amusement. Even if they were in
Class A, it hardly made a difference. Regardless of how they were
using their points, the fact was that they were all enjoying what
this school had to offer to the absolute fullest.
The most annoying thing of all, though, was the fact that
there was a difference in the penalties we faced and the ones the
new students did. We faced expulsion, while all they stood to lose
were three months’ worth of Private Points.
“Look at ’em, not a care in the world, man,” said Sudou.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_107">
<p>“I wouldn’t be talking if I were you, Sudou-kun. Have you
forgotten what you were like a year ago?” said Horikita.
“N-no, I didn’t forget or anythin’… I’ve been doin’ a lot of
soul searchin’,” said Sudou.
Probably because he was the first student in our class to be
faced with the real threat of being expelled. The relief measure
that we had utilized at the time was no longer available to us, of
course. The privilege of being beginners had already been used
up.
“For the time being, let’s try talking with a group of people,”
said Horikita, spotting a group of three first-year guys sitting on a
bench, chatting and laughing among themselves.
Their names were Kaga, Mikami, and Shiratori. They were all
students in Class 1-D and all had an academic ability ranking of B-
or better. Before calling out to these students, Horikita had pulled
up their information in the app, just to be sure. It seemed she
hadn’t changed her mind about going after students from Class 1-
D, after all.
“Excuse me, do you have a moment?” asked Horikita.
“…What is it?” replied one of the students.
They could probably tell just by glancing at us that they were
dealing with upperclassmen. The joyful expressions quietly faded
from their faces and were quickly replaced with looks of caution.
“We’re looking for partners for the upcoming special exam.
Have you found partners yourselves yet?” she asked.
“Oh, uh, no. We still haven’t partnered up with anyone yet,”
said one of the students.
“If you’d like, we’d be happy to talk to you about partnering
up,” said Horikita.
“Yeah, we’d definitely be okay with that. Right?” said one of
the students.
After hearing Horikita’s proposal, the three of them nodded
in response, almost as if they had discussed matters in advance.
We got an unexpectedly good vibe from their response, and it</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_108">
<p>seemed like they had relaxed their guard a little bit. Sudou looked
surprised, like he could hardly believe how positive they were
acting.
“However, while I’m very sorry to say this, our top priority
right now is to find—”
“Partners who can help out the students with poor grades to
prevent them from being expelled, right?” said one of the
students, finishing Horikita’s sentence.
It seemed that idea had already spread among the new
students.
“Yes. If you understand that already, then this discussion will
be quick,” said Horikita.
“Um, well… so, you’d like… one of us to team up with Sudou-
senpai?” asked one of the students.
They’d also checked out our profiles on their phones, which
was why they had no hesitation in talking with us.
“Yes. He’s one of the students we’d like to find a partner for.
There are many others, as well,” said Horikita.
“Oh, okay, I see. Let’s see, Sudou-senpai has an academic
ability ranking of E+, huh… That does sound quite difficult,” said
the student.
He was being diplomatic, but it was still clear he was pointing
out just how low Sudou’s academic ability ranking was. Even
though what he said was true, Sudou seemed upset. Still, he
barely managed to keep it together and not let his dissatisfaction
show on his face.
“Shiratori, you should be able to handle it just fine, right?”
The other two students looked to Shiratori, who sat at the
far-right end of the bench.
“My academic ability ranking is A, at least for the time being,”
said Shiratori.
“Yes, so it seems. If you’re willing to partner with him, I
would certainly not complain,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_109">
<p>“In that case… how about this much?” Shiratori held out his
hand with all five fingers up, making a proposal in return.
For a moment, Horikita didn’t understand what he was
suggesting, so she looked back at Sudou and me.
“My oh my. You want to partner up, right? If so, I should
think something like this would be obvious. No?” said Shiratori.
When Horikita heard that, she understood what he meant.
“…I suppose you’re referring to Private Points.”
“Of course. I mean, if someone like myself were to team up
with a smart student, I could shoot for the top spot. Since I’ll be
giving up a chance at getting the top-tier rewards by partnering
with a student with a low academic ranking, it’s only natural that I
ask for something in return,” said Shiratori.
“Say what? You want points from us?! And you’re askin’ for
fifty thousand…? Dude, that’s way too much,” said Sudou.
For someone like Sudou, who was constantly short on funds
every day, that was an extraordinary number of points to ask for.
“Senpai, please stop joking around. There’s no way I could
accept fifty-thousand,” said Shiratori.
“Huh?” said Sudou.
“I meant five hundred thousand. If you can give me five
hundred thousand, I’ll happily partner up with you right here and
now,” said Shiratori.
“F-five hundred thousand?!” shouted Sudou.
“It would be quite difficult for you if a student got expelled
from your class, right? We’ve been doing a bit of research
ourselves, you see,” said Shiratori.
Apparently, this year’s batch of new students were quite
different from how we’d been last year. They had already begun to
understand how this school worked, and on top of that, they
understood their value. Between our grade level and theirs, it was
difficult to tell which of us were the seniors and which the juniors.
Looking at the situation we were in, it could easily be interpreted
the other way around.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_110">
<p>“It’s certainly natural to want some kind of remuneration if
you’re being asked to partner with someone with a low academic
ability ranking,” said Horikita.
“H-hey, Suzune! I ain’t got five hundred large though,
y’know?” said Sudou.
“I know that. Be quiet for a minute,” said Horikita.
The three first-year students wore sarcastic, wry smiles on
their faces after hearing Sudou carelessly divulge his financial
circumstances.
“It’s only natural to want points, yes. However, is chasing
after short-term desires really a good idea?” said Horikita.
“Meaning?” asked Shiratori, speaking as a representative of
the three students.
“Meaning that if you ingratiate yourselves with us here and
now, we might be able to provide help to you down the road, in
similar situations,” said Horikita, explaining to them that it would
be to their advantage later if they were to exchange in some give-
and-take with us in a form other than Private Points.
“Well, putting you aside, Horikita-senpai, since you have an A
ranking, I can’t really imagine having Sudou-senpai or Ayanokouji-
senpai there would really be of any help to us. Wouldn’t you say?”
said Shiratori.
“That’s not necessarily true. This school isn’t just about
academics. There are times when you’ll need physical ability, too,”
said Horikita.
That was especially applicable to Sudou, as he was the only
student in our grade level who had an A+ in physical ability.
Horikita had been intending to use that as a weapon in her arsenal
for this negotiation, but…
“I know that. But still, you’re just Class D in the end, right? If
we were to ingratiate ourselves within anyone, it would be Class A
or Class B,” said Shiratori calmly, having apparently come to an
objective conclusion.
Seeing that, Horikita probably understood. “…I see. So that’s
how it is.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_111">
<p>Considering how smoothly they handled themselves after
hearing our offer and the number of points they came back with as
a counter-offer, we didn’t need to think too hard about what was
going on here.
“Wh-what do you mean by that?” asked Sudou.
“Before you arrived, we were approached by senior students
from other classes,” said Shiratori.
“And they told you not to sell your academic abilities for
cheap. Right?” asked Horikita.
“Yes. Please understand that we won’t partner with you if
you do not offer us suitable compensation in points,” said Shiratori.
In the face of Shiratori and his classmates, Horikita kept her
composure, and then continued talking.
“It’s certainly true that you shouldn’t sell yourself cheaply, in
that case. However, were you really approached by other students
from our grade, though?” said Horikita.
“What do you mean by that?” asked Shiratori. He looked
irritated, like his pride as an A-ranked student had been wounded.
“You’re also in Class D, just like us. I can’t imagine students
from higher-level classes would have approached you so casually,”
said Horikita.
Horikita was bluffing. As long as you had an elevated level of
academic ability, you’d be useful to have around in this exam,
regardless of whether you were in Class D. She was trying to
confirm who had talked to them, and how much they had said.
Perhaps because Shiratori’s pride had been called into
question, he rebutted this in a somewhat abrasive tone.
“It’s true, though. We were invited by Hashimoto-senpai from
Class 2-A. On top of that, we were approached by students from
Class 2-C, who offered us quite a few points to partner up with
them. Isn’t that right?” said Shiratori, glancing at his friends, who
both immediately voiced their agreement.
“We’re not the only ones, either. Most of the smart kids have
been approached,” added Shiratori.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_112">
<p>Just as Horikita had calculated, Class 2-A and Class C had
gone with the idea of trying to buy students out.
“I see… In that case, I suppose we cannot meet your
expectations right now,” said Horikita.
“Oh, but as long as you give us points, we will not refuse
you. We intend to see how things go for about a week. If you were
to offer us five hundred thousand points during that time, we’d be
happy to partner with anyone, even Sudou-senpai,” said Shiratori.
Five hundred thousand points to prevent someone from
getting expelled. A large sum to be sure, but if you looked at it
from another angle, you could say it was the price of your safety.
However, we couldn’t make a snap decision here. Nor did we
intend to.
“By the way… How many points did Hashimoto-kun and the
others offer you for your cooperation?” asked Horikita.
She was hoping to know the specific number of points that
were offered, but Shiratori and his buddies weren’t that naïve.
“We promised not to say. All I will say is that for five hundred
thousand points, we will help you,” said Shiratori.
“I understand. I will take that into consideration. However,
we would like to ask you for one favor. Would you be willing to
introduce us to some of your fellow students in Class D?” asked
Horikita.
“Introduce?” Shiratori repeated.
“We’ve already prepared to work with your class, to a certain
extent. But approaching each person individually and explaining
the same thing over and over would take up a lot of time and
energy. If possible, we’d like to gather all of you in one place and
have a more concrete discussion then,” said Horikita.
She had hinted at the idea of forming a partnership, but
didn’t say specifically what that would look like. The three students
exchanged glances, though they all looked uncomfortable about
something.
“That’s… Well, asking us to do something like that might be a
little difficult… Right, guys?”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_113">
<p>“Yeah. If we go ahead and do something like that without
getting permission, Housen-kun will probably get mad at us. Don’t
you think?”
The name ‘Housen’ came up in the conversation they were
having among themselves.
“I’m sorry senpai, but could you please ask someone else to
handle that…?” asked Shiratori.
It seemed Housen was the one who held Class 1-D’s leashes,
after all. Horikita, sensing that the mood had clearly changed,
decided not to pursue the matter further. “Thank you. I will call on
you again if the need arises,” she said.
“A-all right. We’ll be waiting,” said Shiratori.
We walked away from the bench and started heading
towards the café on the second floor. I secretly peeked back at
them as we left, and saw that Shiratori, phone in hand, seemed to
be hurriedly calling someone.
“We got some information, but it’s hard to say that we made
any actual progress. The only thing we know for sure is that if we
were to offer them an absolutely absurd five hundred thousand
points, they would agree to cooperate with us on the spot,” said
Horikita.
“They’re totally tryin’ to take advantage of us and price
gouge, makin’ those ridiculous demands,” huffed Sudou.
“It certainly is a ridiculous amount they’re asking for, yes. But
it’s also true that they have no reason to sell their talents on the
cheap,” said Horikita.
Even more so if they were ranked A in academic ability. This
was certainly a much more direct way of earning points than
shooting for the one-hundred-thousand-point reward for getting
high marks on the exam.
“So in the end, the only way for me to save myself is by
payin’ somebody a bunch of Private Points?” asked Sudou.
“It’s certainly getting harder and harder to say for sure that
there are any students out there who will help you for free.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_114">
<p>The notion that points would be the key to forming
partnerships had already spread. It would be best if we assumed it
wasn’t just Shiratori and his friends who believed so, but rather
that their entire grade level knew to ask for points in exchange for
partnerships.
I was sure we could safely say this was part of Sakayanagi
and Ryuuen’s strategy, too. Normally, doing things in exchange for
points was frowned upon. Such transactions brought with them a
sense of shame, and so, they were usually done in secret. But by
conducting a large-scale buy out operation, they had essentially
made the new students realize that offering their services for free
would be losing out.
Even so, there was something that bothered me about the
conversation we just had with Shiratori and his classmates earlier.
Though they had already been approached by students from other
classes, they’d said that they were going to wait a week. Even if
they were just waiting that long so they could try and fish for more
points, I was concerned by the fact that all three of them had
seemed to be in agreement about their course of action from the
very beginning.
I would have thought students would have wanted to seek
reassurance by finding a partner right away. Was it just that those
particular three happened to be bullheaded? Or perhaps…
“Even if we continue to ask around randomly like this, we’ll
probably keep getting the same answers, won’t we?” I told them.
Scoping out Class 1-D was fun and all, but the real problem
came after that. What Shiratori and his friends said about Housen
getting angry with them if they acted without permission stuck in
my mind. Judging from the way Shiratori and his friends talked, I
was certain that Housen Kazuomi oversaw their entire class.
“Housen likely gave his classmates some instructions,” I
added. “He probably told them something like, ‘Hey, you can team
up with anybody you want, but you can only make a snap decision
to team up if they offer you five hundred thousand points. If they
don’t make that offer, put their request to team up on hold, even if
they’re from Class A,’ or something like that.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_115">
<p>“But wait, if they do that, won’t that mean Class 1-D gets left
behind?” asked Sudou.
“I’m saying they’re planning on that happening. They intend
to be the last ones,” I replied.
“Huh? I don’t get it,” said Sudou.
“It’s only we second-year students who are afraid of getting
hit with the penalty for not finding a partner. He was probably
thinking that he can hold that over our heads and use it to rip us
off for as many Private Points as possible toward the end,” I told
him.
If all the honors students outside of Class 1-D had already
been bought up, we’d eventually have no choice but to shell out to
get the ones from Class D to cooperate with us, whether we liked
it or not. Even if that meant paying a million or two million.
“It’s an incredibly rash strategy, made with absolutely no
thought about what’ll happen in the future,” said Horikita.
“Tell me again, how exactly do you plan on fighting this?” I
said.
We’d already figured out what Class 1-D was planning to do.
So, having taken that into account, I wanted to know what Horikita
was thinking. Would she try and force herself in between what
Class 2-A and Class C were starting to do right now, with their
extreme buy-out strategies? Or would she perhaps adopt a
strategy more like what Ichinose was doing, forming relationships
built on trust by accepting many lower-ranked students, regardless
of what class they were in, and appealing to the honors students
for their cooperation?
“I decided to set three goals when we heard the outline for
this particular special exam,” said Horikita.
“Three goals?” asked Sudou.
He seemed to be interested in what she was about to say,
since he was leaning in closer.
“The most important of which is to not let anyone from our
class get expelled. That goes without saying,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_116">
<p>“Yeah, for sure,” replied Sudou, nodding.
“The second is to shoot for third place or better in overall
points, in the competition against other classes,” said Horikita.
“Wait, third? You mean we’re throwin’ away our shot of going
after first or second right from the get-go?” asked Sudou.
“No one said anything about throwing away our shot of
going after those places. I said third place or better,” said Horikita.
True enough, saying she was hoping for third place or better
technically included first- and second-place. But that didn’t seem to
be precisely what she meant, and it most likely had something to
do with her third goal.
“My third goal is to avoid participating in these money
games. I plan to do battle with those three principles in mind,” said
Horikita.
“Huh…? B-but…” stammered Sudou.
“I understand what you want to say. Namely, that if we’re
not going to compete using Private Points, then we have no hope
of winning this thing. However, even if we try and compete using
the points that we have, the reward isn’t worth the risk. Even if we
do finish in first place overall, we will only gain fifty Class Points.
Meaning that over the course of a year, our class would only get a
little over two million Private Points,” said Horikita.
If we got five thousand points per person per month,
(excluding the deposit that we got in April, which had already
passed) and multiplied that amount by the remaining eleven
months, then we’d end up with two million, one hundred and forty-
five thousand Private Points.
“And if we pay five hundred thousand points per person, that
means we’d be in the red after paying for five people. We can’t
possibly be so naïve as to think that we could win this thing just by
getting four or so first-years who have an academic ability ranking
of A, right?” said Horikita.
Even if we were to carry that into the next two years—that
is, until we graduated—it would still only be four million, four
hundred and eighty-five thousand Private Points. Which covered a</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_117">
<p>maximum of eight recruits. Moreover, this was all based on the
supposition that not only could we assuredly draw in those
students at five hundred thousand at most, but also, that we
would be getting first place in the overall rankings by grade level.
Considering the risks, it would likely be far more efficient for us to
simply wait for an upcoming special exam and use our Private
Points then.
“Private Points and Class Points are not equal. I’m well aware
that there is more to it than just what we get in return. However, I
think that even if we do pump all our points into this test, we’d
only have a slim chance of winning, so we shouldn’t try and push
it. Am I wrong, Ayanokouji-kun?” asked Horikita.
“Not at all. Your decision is the right one,” I replied.
The difference in overall academic ability between us and
Class 2-A had been clear from the start. If we wanted to win
overall, I couldn’t really imagine we’d gain much of an advantage
from bringing in eight students. Of course, Horikita was
resourceful. She would probably consider paying out Private Points
if there were students who were willing to partner up for fifty or a
hundred thousand. It was just that she didn’t want this battle to
come down to what was in our bank accounts.
“In order to achieve those three goals, I still think we should
try to negotiate with Class 1-D, after all,” said Horikita.
“Wh-why though? Weren’t all the kids in their class told by
Housen not to team up with us for anythin’ less than five hundred
large?” said Sudou.
“As far as the honors students are concerned, yes, that’s
true. However, there are students in their class who have an
academic ability ranking of C or below, too. What do you think
would happen if they were neglected?” asked Horikita.
“What would happen…?” repeated Sudou.
“Students who should normally have been fine would also
receive penalties, and their position would be thrown into
question,” I replied.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_118">
<p>Horikita nodded at what I said, and then continued from
there.
“There’s no way those students would willingly give up the
Private Points they could get every month. Which means at some
point, Housen-kun will have no choice but to abandon his current
stance,” said Horikita.
Even if all the honors students in 1-D tried selling themselves
for five hundred thousand points, the rest of the students in their
class couldn’t do the same. Putting aside the issue of whether
second-year students would get expelled or not, Housen would fall
behind in the battle between the first-years.
“If he’s looking for a way to win, there will definitely be an
opening that we can exploit,” said Horikita.
It seemed she was intent on dealing with Class 1-D then, the
class that everyone else wanted to avoid.
“That being said, it would be dangerous for all thirty-nine of
us to try and engage with Housen-kun’s class. We need to
minimize the risk as much as possible,” said Horikita.
If our negotiations failed, then it would be the students with
less academic skill who would be in trouble.
“Considering that the exam period has only just begun, I
suppose it’s not strange some kids are asking for entirely
unreasonable conditions to partner up,” said Horikita.
“Well, I hope you’re right… I mean, as far as I’m concerned
though, I kinda doubt there’s anyone out there for me,” said
Sudou.
“In any case, the only way we’ll find gifted partners is to
reach out to a lot of people,” said Horikita.
As we were waking up the steps to the café on the second
floor though, we heard a voice come from behind us.
“Hey! If you’re looking for a gifted partner, I’m right here,
y’know?”
When we turned around, we saw a lone female student
looking over at us, with a big grin on her face, from ear to ear. As</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_119">
<p>soon as our eyes met, she slowly walked up the steps. Horikita
was the first one of us to let her suspicions show on her face.
“Were you eavesdropping on us?” she asked.
“Oh, gosh, no, senpai, I just shouted out because I only
happened to hear what you were saying is all. And umm…” The girl
spoke without looking over at Sudou or me, keeping her gaze
locked onto Horikita. “Senpai, what’s your name and academic
ability ranking?”
“… My name’s Horikita. I’m from Class 2-D. My academic
ability score is A-. What of it?” she asked.
“Oh, wow, you’re smart!” replied the girl.
“And your name is?”
“I’m Ichika Amasawa. From Class 1-A. I’m the same as you,
Horikita-senpai. I’ve got an A in academic ability.”
She looks like a girl who only cares about popularity, but is
actually quite a smart student. Just to be sure, Horikita checked
her information in the app.
“If you want to shoot for the top, I’ll work with you. Okay?”
Amasawa asked that question without even asking anything
about our backgrounds. If students with A- and A ratings teamed
up together, it certainly wouldn’t be impossible for them to get first
place. As for Horikita, she had deliberately lowered her score for
Sudou’s sake in the past, so if you took that fact into consideration,
it wouldn’t be unfair to say she actually was an A, not an A-.
Though this was unexpected, Horikita could very well end up
settling on a partner for herself, not Sudou or anyone else. This
might be a coincidence, but a student with an academic ability
ranking of A did just reach out to her. If Horikita were to say that
she instead wanted Amasawa to partner with a student with a
lower ranking, Amasawa might choose to walk away.
“I sincerely appreciate the offer, but I’m actually not looking
for a partner right now myself. Instead of partnering with me
though, could I possibly ask you about partnering with him… With
Sudou-kun?” asked Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_120">
<p>Horikita took that risk anyway, introducing the girl to Sudou.
Though Sudou was a little perplexed by the situation, he gently
bowed his head to Amasawa, giving her a proper greeting.
“Uh, let’s see, what’s Sudou-senpai’s academic ability
ranking?” said Amasawa.
“E+. Certainly not a good grade, by any stretch,” said
Horikita.
‘Not good’ was putting it mildly. If anything, he was in the
running for the lowest ranking in our entire grade.
“I gotcha. So that means you’re looking for help, Horikita-
senpai. You’re trying to find a partner for him so that he won’t get
kicked out of school.” Amasawa, having grasped the situation,
looked over at Sudou. “E+, huh. If we teamed up, forget about
getting the top spot. We’d probably end up scoring a little under
the middle of the road.”
“Yes, that’s true. There’s hardly any advantage for you in it,”
said Horikita.
I wondered if Amasawa was going to bring up points now,
but there was no sign she was going to do that.
“Well, still, if you’re askin’ for help, I certainly wouldn’t mind
lending you a hand,” said Amasawa.
Things were clearly looking much more favorable for us than
how they’d gone with those three boys earlier. Amasawa then
looked in my direction.
“What about him? Is he looking for a partner too?” she
asked.
“His academic ability ranking is C. He’s not exactly a top
priority for us. However, if Sudou-kun is a no-go for you, we’d still
be very appreciative if you’d team up with Ayanokouji-kun, as a
worst-case scenario,” said Horikita.
“Wait, no, hold on—” I replied, cutting in.
While this was probably a kind gesture on Horikita’s part, I
had to put a stop to it. I couldn’t just decide upon a partner right
now without thinking about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_121">
<p>“Is there something wrong with her?” asked Horikita.
“No, it’s not like that, it’s—”
“Oh, hey, wait a sec. I still haven’t said which one of them I’ll
pair up with yet though, y’know?” Amasawa, seeing that the
conversation was moving ahead without her actual consent on the
matter, spoke up and put a stop to it.
“Do you have any conditions you would need fulfilled for you
to partner with either of these two, then?” asked Horikita.
“Conditions, conditions, huh. Yeah, okay. I suppose I am
entitled to at least that much, right?” said Amasawa.
Horikita had decided to bring up the topic herself, to see if
Amasawa had any conditions for a partnership. She hadn’t
changed her basic policy of avoiding engaging in a spending
competition with the other classes using Private Points, but if
Amasawa’s price was low enough, there was room for
consideration. I just prayed it wasn’t too high a price, like what
Shiratori and his friends were asking for…
“Well, I really like strong people, y’know,” said Amasawa,
saying something that had absolutely nothing to do with this exam
while wearing a devilish little grin.
“What in the world are you talking about?” Horikita furrowed
her brow suspiciously, having expected the topic of discussion to
shift from studies to points.
“Well, it’s like, I was racking my brain over what I should do
for this exam and stuff. I was thinking, should I study super hard,
team up with someone around A-rank like Horikita-senpai, and try
and shoot for the top? …Or, like, should I kinda take it easy, just
try and get through the exam? And if I’m going to take it easy in
the test, I’d wanna team up with someone I like, you know what I
mean?” said Amasawa.
I supposed that was certainly preferable to working with
someone you didn’t like or someone you didn’t care about at all.
“I like strong guys,” added Amasawa, repeating what she
had just said earlier. Horikita’s head spun as she tried to
understand what Amasawa was saying.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_122">
<p>“Meaning… you’re asking if Sudou-kun is strong or not,
then?” asked Horikita.
“Right. And I’m not talking about, like, being mentally strong
or anything. I’m asking about whether he’s physically strong. Well,
I can tell easily enough that you do sports or stuff just from
looking at your physique,” said Amasawa, pointing her finger at
Sudou, a student who normally should be a non-entity to someone
with an A in academic ability.
Sudou was confident of his strength, so while he was
somewhat shy about it, he nodded in agreement.
“You wanna partner with me?” asked Amasawa, extending
her hand and caressing Sudou’s cheek.
“W-well, I mean, if I had an A in academics, then we’d be a
lot better off though… Are you really okay with me?” said Sudou.
“If you really are strong, then sure,” said Amasawa.
She ran her thin fingertip along Sudou’s chest, mesmerizing
him with her allure.
“I-I’m strong,” he replied.
“Well, I don’t dislike guys who are full of confidence,” said
Amasawa.
“What exactly do you mean, if he’s really strong?” Horikita,
who had taken on the responsibility of getting Sudou situated,
expressed her lack of understanding of what Amasawa was talking
about.
“It means what it sounds like. I like strong people who are
good in a fight. That’s why I wanna partner up with someone
strong,” said Amasawa.
“In that case, I think Sudou-kun can measure up. I can
vouch for his physical strength,” said Horikita.
“Words aren’t enough for me, though. I’ll have to confirm it
with my own eyes,” said Amasawa.
“…With your own eyes?” asked Horikita.
“I mean like, go out, round up a bunch of strong second-
years, have ’em fight each other. And then I’ll partner up with the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_123">
<p>toughest one there,” said Amasawa.
“Are you joking? There’s no way we could do something like
that,” said Horikita.
“Why not? Hey, I’ve been serious this whole time we’ve been
talking, right?”
Sudou, who couldn’t believe Amasawa was being serious
either, spoke. “Let’s go, Suzune. Stayin’ here’s just a waste of
time.”
It sounded almost as though he was admonishing himself for
falling for Amasawa’s charms, even if only for a moment.
“Eh, I don’t really care if you just wanna pretend this
conversation never happened,” said Amasawa.
She was saying that to her, this whole thing was nothing
more than a little fun. She certainly didn’t have to go out of her
way to partner up with an E+ ranked student, if she wanted.
Considering the fact that Amasawa’s class and abilities were
nothing to scoff at, she’d probably have no shortage of people
willing to pay to be with her.
Still, this might be fortunate for us, to a certain extent. If we
agreed to her request, Sudou would gain the right to partner with
a student with A-rank academic ability. And even if he didn’t end
up getting to partner with her, we lost nothing.
“You’re not saying this just to make fun of us, then? You’re
really serious about this?” asked Horikita in response, a serious
look in her eyes.
“Of course I’m serious,” said Amasawa.
“I see. In that case, I suppose we’ll take this seriously too,
and hear you out,” said Horikita.
“H-Hey, Suzune?” said Sudou.
“Come on, it’s fine! I wanna team up with someone strong,
after all,” said Amasawa.
“All right. In that case, Sudou-kun, you should accept her
offer,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_124">
<p>“W-wait, hold up, Suzune. The school ain’t just gonna let us
have a fight or whatever. Stuff’ll get pretty bad if we fight, won’t
it? I mean like what happened last year, and at lunch, with that
little tussle with that Housen dude. Right?” said Sudou.
Last year, Sudou had gotten in a fight with several guys from
Ryuuen’s class and it had turned into quite the problem. And just
today, there had been a big commotion when Housen came by.
“It’s certainly true that fighting isn’t exactly praiseworthy. But
if both sides consent, there should be no issue. Don’t you think so,
Ayanokouji-kun?” said Horikita.
I took a moment to consider what Horikita’s intentions were
in asking me that question. If she was asking me if there was no
issue with such a fight, then my answer would obviously be that
yes, there would be issues. Win or lose, even if both parties
agreed to fight and then started swinging, there was essentially no
way that school administrators would approve of something that
essentially amounted to a duel. However, Horikita had responded
to Amasawa in a way that sounded like she was condoning the
idea of such a brawl.
“I suppose you’re right. If school officials heard talk of a
fight, there’s no way they’d agree to let it happen. If the students
involved all consent to the fight, however, it doesn’t seem like it’d
be a huge issue.” I purposefully answered her back in a way that
communicated I had no problem with it.
“H-hey, Ayanokouji!” wailed Sudou.
“On top of that, no matter who you picked from our grade
level, no one would be able to beat Sudou-kun in a fight,” said
Horikita.
“Got that right,” I replied.
Sudou didn’t understand what was going on, but Horikita and
I were taking turns passing the baton back and forth to each other
in this conversation. The important thing right now wasn’t to affirm
the idea of actually having a fight. It was to prove that Sudou was
the strongest—without actually having him fight anyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_125">
<p>“To be frank, Sudou-kun, this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity. Think about it. Normally, it would be extremely
difficult to pair you up with a student with A-rank academic ability.
However, Amasawa-san has said that she’s willing to partner with
you. Understand? On top of that, she’s agreeing to partner with
you on the condition of you winning a fight. A test of strength.
Something you’re better at than anyone else. You should take this
deal without a second’s hesitation,” said Horikita.
There was no way a second-year student familiar with the
school rules would carelessly agree to engage in a fight like this.
On top of that, if their opponent was Sudou, the outcome was as
clear as day. In other words…even if we agreed to her terms here
and now, the fight might never actually end up taking place. And
even in the off chance that someone did take the challenge, Sudou
could put them down.
“Ooh, nice! Nice! I’m gettin’ kind of excited!” Amasawa,
having just enrolled here, naturally knew none of this. There was
no way she could understand how different this place was from a
normal junior high or high school.
“But, could you promise us one thing, first? If no one shows
up to this fight other than Sudou-kun, then you’ll agree to partner
with him,” said Horikita, hoping to confirm an important part of the
deal.
If Amasawa didn’t agree to that condition, this discussion
would go any further.
“Sure. I promise. If no challenger shows up, then he’ll win by
default,” said Amasawa.
After Amasawa gave us her word, Horikita nodded,
apparently satisfied.
“All right, Sudou-kun?” she asked, turning to Sudou.
“…Sure. If you don’t have a problem with it, Suzune, then I
don’t mind at all,” said Sudou, balling both his hands into fists and
then smacking them together in front of him, hard.
As far as Horikita was concerned, Amasawa’s proposal was
both a product of chance and an invaluable opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_126">
<p>“Okey dokey, I’ll post a general message in the app for
everyone to see. I’ll tell anyone who feels confident about their
physical strength to shoot me a direct message before the end of
the day if they wanna join in,” said Amasawa.
“Heh. No matter who shows up, I’ll take ’em.” Conveniently
enough, Sudou didn’t seem to understand what Horikita was
thinking. He was probably just getting excited over the idea of
fighting somebody hand-to-hand.
“Would it be all right if we select the location? We’d prefer
not to unintentionally let things slip to the school,” said Horikita.
“Yeah, sure. I think you guys would probably know more
about that than me anyway. I’ll let you handle that part.” Amasawa
must have finished composing her message, because she turned to
us for a final confirmation before sending it out. “Okay, so once
this goes out, we’ll have our little test of strength. That okay with
you?”
Horikita nodded back in response. Amasawa slowly looked
over all three of us. Then she turned her phone’s screen off and
put it back in her pocket.
“Actually, let’s not, after all,” said Amasawa.
I had thought maybe she had a sudden change of heart, but
that didn’t seem to be the case. Judging from the look on her face,
we should assume that she had been testing us, trying to feel us
out. However, both Horikita and Sudou were flustered by
Amasawa’s abrupt change.
“What’s wrong?” asked Horikita.
“Even if I put out a message asking for people, it doesn’t
seem like anyone would show up. Based on Sudou-senpai’s
physique, and the way both Horikita-senpai and Ayanokouji-senpai
are acting, I can tell he’s top dog in terms of strength in your
grade level,” said Amasawa.
So she’d come to understand there was no need to go
through the trouble of making people fight to compare them. It
seemed the little act Horikita and I had put on, as well as Sudou’s
natural reaction, had been even more effective than we had</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_127">
<p>expected. If Amasawa had only noticed all this after she posted
the message, Horikita probably wouldn’t have let her take it back.
In order to not let Amasawa realize that we had been acting
before, Horikita expressed her dissatisfaction. “Are you making fun
of us?”
“No way, it’s nothing like that, really. It’s just, like, it’s no fun
when the outcome’s so obvious. I just want to see it with my own
eyes and make sure he’s the strongest. So please don’t get all mad
at me, senpai.”
Amasawa pressed her forefinger against her lips, lost in
thought for a moment.
“I’ll still give you a chance though, so come on, forgive me?”
she added.
Horikita was trying to stay in control of the conversation, but
kept getting knocked off balance by Amasawa’s peculiar approach.
It seemed she didn’t jive so well with people like Amasawa.
“Well, I guess besides strong guys, I like guys who can
cook,” said Amasawa.
“Cook?” said Horikita.
Amasawa’s newest suggestion was once again something
completely unrelated to the special exam.
“So, Sudou-senpai, right? Would you make me a home-
cooked meal? Something, like, super extra yummy?” said
Amasawa.
“A h-home-cooked meal?!” stammered Sudou.
Sudou, who had been brimming with confidence just
moments ago, now seemed overcome with shock after hearing her
unexpected request.
“I mean, it being tasty is a prerequisite, of course. It’s gotta
be good. But you also have to make something that I specifically
request,” said Amasawa.
“W-wait, I ain’t ever cooked a meal in my life—”
“Is that so? Well, I guess that means I take back giving you
a chance, hmm,” replied Amasawa, cutting him off.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_128">
<p>Horikita jumped into the conversation, not wanting to let this
opportunity pass us by. “Can I do it then, in Sudou-kun’s place?”
“Nope. I told you before, didn’t I? I said I like guys who can
cook. ’Sides, if the guy I’m partnering up with can’t cook, then
there’s no point in partnering with them at all,” said Amasawa.
Meaning it didn’t matter how well Horikita could cook. If you
were a girl, Amasawa wasn’t interested.
“Well, if Sudou-senpai is no good, why not give up on him
and try to find a classmate who can cook? Oh, is that because
even if you did go out and find someone in a hurry, I still wouldn’t
be partnering with Sudou-senpai then, hm?” said Amasawa,
flashing a devilish grin. “Maybe you should work on turning Sudou-
senpai into a master cook. Of course, I gotta wonder if you can
really do that in time, huh. I am pretty popular, you know. If you
don’t hurry, I’ll probably find a partner.”
That wasn’t just a hollow threat. She would probably find a
partner in the not-too-distant future. There were many
exceptionally talented students other than Horikita in our grade
level. There was no need for Amasawa to deliberately take on the
risk of partnering with the likes of Sudou. If anything, this was
nothing more than a playful whim on her part. If she changed her
mind even a little, that would be the end of it.
But a classmate who had poor grades and was a guy who
was good at cooking? No one else came to mind at the moment.
In that case, this request from Amasawa might just be a no-go for
Class D. Giving up on her and going after other students would
probably be a better use of our time.
When Amasawa saw we weren’t giving her an answer, she
went on to add something else.
“Okay. Well, how about I give you a little special treatment? I
did want to partner with a guy who’s good at cooking, but… If you
can satisfy my taste buds, I’d be willing to team up with a good
fighter like Sudou-senpai,” said Amasawa.
She was offering us a compromise. Amasawa wanted to
partner up with a guy who was a good fighter or a good cook. In
that case, we could certainly satisfy her.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_129">
<p>“I guess it would be like teaming up with a good cook and a
good fighter at the same time, huh?” she added.
Amasawa was saying she would be willing to partner up with
Sudou as long as another guy could satisfy her. I wondered how
Horikita would respond…? But the problem was that I couldn’t
really think of a student who fit the bill. We also seriously lacked
the time necessary to teach someone how to cook.
“Ayanokouji-kun. If I recall, you once boasted to me that
you’re quite the skilled cook, didn’t you?” said Horikita.
What in the world was Horikita thinking, asking me a
question like that so openly? I had never once told her anything of
the sort, much less boasted about it. While it would have been
easy for me to deny her assertion, it seemed necessary for me to
play along and make sure our stories matched. The chances of
Sudou being able to partner with a student with an A in academic
ability weren’t exactly high.
“It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that cooking is my
one and only area of expertise,” I replied.
“Yes, quite. Well then, if you’ll permit it, Amasawa-san, how
about Ayanokouji-kun?” asked Horikita.
“As long as it’s a guy, I don’t care who. But is he really a
good cook, though? I mean, you can go ahead and say whatever
you want, talk is cheap, but I’m going to judge you pretty harshly,
okay?” said Amasawa.
“That’ll be fine, of course. Isn’t that right?” said Horikita,
turning to me.
“Yeah, I guess so.”
As soon as I agreed to it, Amasawa immediately clapped her
hands together.
“Okay! How about we get this show on the road and you
show me what you can do?”
Things were moving way too quickly. However, what
Amasawa had just said seemed like she was both sealing the deal
and giving us an ultimatum. She wanted to avoid giving me
enough of a grace period that I could go learn how to cook. She</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_130">
<p>wanted to ascertain whether I really was as good as I claimed to
be.
Since Horikita needed to make sure Amasawa believed her
lie, she couldn’t go ahead and say yes to her request. Even if I
were to go ahead and cook for Amasawa now, with my current
level of skill, it was clear it wouldn’t amount to much. And even if
Amasawa didn’t actually judge me that harshly, I would probably
still end up failing to meet her standards.
“While we’d love to, could you possibly give us a little time?
Ayanokouji-kun and I are in the process of reaching out to first-
year students to find partners for our classmates. Aside from
Sudou-kun, there are many other students who need help. If the
other classes beat us to the punch, then we’ll really be hurting.
Even at this very moment, our rivals are scrambling to find
partners,” said Horikita, explaining our situation to Amasawa, to
see if she understood what we were dealing with. “If possible,
we’d like to put this on hold until after class on Friday.”
She rejected Amasawa’s request to have me cook something
for her right away. On top of that, she asked if we could postpone
things for a couple of days, suggesting we could make some time
on the weekend.
“I see, I see. Well, I suppose you’re right, it wouldn’t be
good for little ol’ me to take up all your time myself.” Then
Amasawa offered a new proposal. “I’d be all right doing it later
tonight, though. What about that? That wouldn’t be a problem,
would it?”
“A first-year student going to a second-year student’s dorm in
the middle of the night—and a boy’s room, to boot—would most
certainly be improper,” said Horikita.
“Oh, I see. But waitin’ until the weekend is kinda tough for
me. And I’d lose the chance to partner up with any other of my
senpai then… Right?”
Just as I’d thought, Horikita’s suggestion to wait until the
weekend wasn’t going to fly. Amasawa came back with a pretty
harsh reply this time.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_131">
<p>“But since this is kinda, like, fate or something, I’ll give you
just one day. If you tell me you can’t cook something for me
tomorrow after class, I guess we’ll just have to pretend this whole
thing never happened,” said Amasawa.
That was probably the very last compromise she was willing
to make. She was drawing a hard line. I got the sense that if we
got too greedy, Amasawa would immediately pull back. If Horikita
didn’t slip up in her bargaining, then…
“You’re right. I certainly cannot deny that my request would
place quite a burden on you. And besides, I’m sure you don’t want
to carelessly give us time to practice cooking. Right?” said Horikita.
“Oh, gosh, no, I didn’t think that far ahead or anything,” said
Amasawa.
“…All right. Can we seal the deal then, with these terms?”
asked Horikita.
We only had one day of preparation time. However, if we
didn’t stick to those terms, we weren’t going to be able to hold
onto Amasawa. What Horikita was agreeing to could be interpreted
as desperate measures taken under pressure of necessity, but she
signaled that she agreed to the amended proposal all the same.
“It’s settled, then.” Amasawa agreed readily, having no
objection to meeting up tomorrow after class like she’d suggested
earlier.
“However, that’s as long as you don’t take back what you
said, like you did earlier when we were talking about having a
fight,” said Horikita.
“Okay. I promise. If I determine that his cooking skills are
legit, then I’ll team up with Sudou-senpai right then and there.”
Although it was just a verbal promise, Amasawa nodded and
answered honestly.
“Please, I’m beggin’ ya, Ayanokouji. Use your cookin’ skills to
get me a partner, somehow!” wailed Sudou.
Given the situation, I figured I’d play along. But I never
imagined things would turn out like this.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_132">
<p>“Okay, so, how about we meet up in front of Keyaki Mall at
four thirty tomorrow after class? Would that be okay, Ayanokouji-
senpai?” asked Amasawa.
“At the mall? Not at the dorms?” I asked in return.
“What I’m gonna ask you to make is a secret! And besides,
you’re gonna have to buy the ingredients and stuff to make it,
right?” said Amasawa.
I see. So she was going to judge me on everything, starting
with what I bought.
“Is it okay if I accompany him too?” asked Horikita, probably
looking to offer me advice, so that our ruse wouldn’t be
discovered.
But our opponent wasn’t going to let that slide so easily.
“Nope! You could give him advice, by like, signaling with your
eyes and stuff. I’m going to be reaaaaaally strict with how I
judge!” said Amasawa.
Meaning I would somehow have to make it work all on my
own tomorrow.
“You’ll be fine, right, Ayanokouji-senpai?” asked Amasawa.
“Yeah, no problem.”
I figured that I’d give her a straight answer for the time
being, but man, this had turned into quite the ordeal.
“Okay, then I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye bye!” said Amasawa,
before proceeding to go back down the stairs, seemingly satisfied.
“Horikita, I’m sure you already know this, but—”
“Be quiet right now. I’m thinking of a plan,” said Horikita,
cutting me off.
Even though she told me she’d think of a plan, we only had
one day. Just how far could I really go, considering I had only the
bare minimum level of cooking skill?</p>

<p class="chapter">Chapter 5:</p>
Ichika’s Test
 
WEDNESDAY ARRIVED, marking the third day of the special
exam period. At eight in the morning, the OAA app was refreshed
for the second time, and the number of partner options we had
inevitably dwindled.
“Thirty-four new partnerships have been decided, huh?”
Combined with the ones decided on Monday, that came to a
total of fifty-six partnerships. Considering that there was a
maximum of one hundred and fifty-seven possible pairs, that
meant that 30 percent of students had already settled into
partnerships.
The number of partnerships established yesterday were
largely driven by Class 2-B, meaning many of them had something
to do with Ichinose. It seemed several first-year students had
carefully thought through their options after the meet-and-greet,
and then decided to partner up afterward. Basically, I could
confirm that many first-year students with a low level of academic
ability had partnered with Ichinose and others from her class. Also,
considering that some honors students’ names were now gone
from the list of first-years, and some names of Class 2-C students
were also gone, I could infer that Class C had successfully
negotiated a few using points or the like.
In my own class, five partnerships had been decided, starting
with Kushida. I checked Class 1-B’s page and saw that Yagami
Takuya also had a partner. He might have paired up with Kushida.
But the strange thing was that not a single person from Class 1-D
had formed a partnership yet. Looking at the entirety of both of
our grade levels, this was unique. If I didn’t get out there and
really make a move now, I would probably be stuck. There wasn’t
a single student here who could look at my scores objectively and
tell me, ‘Hey, let’s team up.’
It was only natural that a student, regardless of whether
they were academically gifted or not themselves, would want to
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_134">
<p>team up with someone smart. Unlike the second-year students,
who had learned to act for the sake of the class, the first-year
students probably weren’t going to care that much about anyone
else. They were more likely to see even their own classmates as
rivals.
At the very least, people would put off looking at me until
the high achieving students were taken. That was exactly why
Tsukishiro must have told his agent not to let this opportunity slip
by. Naturally, any student who came to me looking for a
partnership or allowed me to partner with them would arouse my
suspicion flag. However, if I remained indecisive forever and didn’t
settle on a partner, my chances of getting paired up with
Tsukishiro’s assassin would increase.
I needed to be certain that my partner wasn’t Tsukishiro’s
assassin, but that probably wasn’t going to be easy. In truth, I
couldn’t even imagine what kind of act this person was putting on
to pass off as someone else. I could look up everyone’s face,
name, and scores in the OAA app, but there were no clues to be
found there. If all one hundred and sixty first-year students were
my enemies, then that would be checkmate for me. No hope of
escape.
That was such a ridiculous notion. I didn’t think even
Tsukishiro could possibly pull all that off, but…
No, that wasn’t it. The important thing was for me to figure
out a way to survive, even if everyone was my enemy. For now, I
needed to pick a safe choice from the remaining one-hundred and
four available students. There was no discrimination on the basis
of sex for students raised in the White Room, making it impossible
to narrow down the list of suspects on that front because they
adhered to gender equality as a principle.
So how should I exclude people as possible suspects? One
conceivable way would be based on physique. Meals served in the
White Room were strictly controlled, down to the finest details. It
was basically unthinkable that any child raised in that environment
could become obese. Meaning that if I were to pick an obese
student as my partner, I could avoid the White Room agent… That
was one simple plan that came to mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_135">
<p>But that wasn’t an absolute guarantee. It was entirely
possible that the student from the White Room had been preparing
to get me expelled for several months now. With that in mind, it
wouldn’t be impossible for them to plump up or slim down if they
wanted to. That would be easy for someone who endured the
rigorous curriculum of the White Room to pull off.
But even if I were to put all that aside, I still had some
doubts about choosing a student with a sub-standard physique.
Granted, it was hard to be sure, because full body pictures weren’t
displayed in the OAA app. There were only two students who were
clearly obese, but I couldn’t rule out the possibility that either of
them could have been sent by Tsukishiro. That was because I had
to assume that the assassin might not just be someone from the
White Room, but also someone from the general student
population. They might have been offered the chance of going to a
better college upon graduation if they got me expelled, for
instance.
My next thought was to see if I could narrow down the list
based on academic ability. That would also be difficult. If the
student came from the White Room, then it wouldn’t be a problem
at all for them to get a perfect score on the entrance exam. They
could easily get an academic ability ranking of A or A+ without
even trying.
In other words, they could freely control what scores they
got. And I was sure whoever this agent was had heard about the
OAA app being implemented. It wouldn’t even be surprising if the
agent had gotten an academic ability ranking of E and was lying in
wait for me. Similarly, it would be impossible for me to narrow it
down based on whether they had been sorted into Class A or Class
D.
I understood all that, but right now, I had nothing to work
with. No way to narrow down the list of suspects, no matter what
angle I came at this situation from. There was something I needed
to do now. Namely, I needed to look at students with my own two
eyes and confirm their authenticity. If I knew for sure that they
weren’t not my enemy, I could partner with them or ask them to
become a collaborator.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_136">
<p>I set myself one goal. Starting today, whenever I arrived at
class in the morning, during lunch, and after class ended, I would
reach out to the first-year students that I saw over the course of
the day, in the order I saw them. Then, I would try to gain their
cooperation. There was no way Tsukishiro had sent someone I
could detect at a glance, so I had no choice but to fight back with
the element of chance, which was something he couldn’t interfere
with.
My academic ability ranking, C, was by no means high. I
wouldn’t be able to use that as a weapon. But it wasn’t like there
would be no students willing to partner up with me. If I did some
digging, I’d probably find some people.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_137">
<p>5.1
 
I WALKED OUT OF THE DORMS and headed to the school building.
While on my way, I quickly spotted a couple of first-year girls
walking along and chatting with one another. Their names were
Kurihara Kasuga and Konishi Tetsuko. They were both in Class A,
but unfortunately, also academically gifted students who had
solidified partnerships on the first day. It would be impossible for
me to ask either of them to be my partner.
Well, I supposed the fact that they’d already decided on their
partners wasn’t that much of a problem. If anything, it made them
the best kind of students to turn into collaborators.
It’s just, well, it was kind of difficult for me to actually talk to
them…
Even though there was the fact that I’d be approaching them
under the pretense of needing to find a partner for this special
exam, how exactly would a second-year guy approaching a couple
of first-year girls appear to an observer? I couldn’t help but
wonder. I didn’t really have the guts to just start talking to them
and go “Good morning!” like Yousuke or anything. It was probably
out of the question for me to just stroll up to them and confidently
ask them to introduce me to a friend I could pair up with, too.
At any rate, I couldn’t afford not to at least try. Giving in
right here and now wouldn’t exactly be smart. Right. Precisely so.
I’d made up my mind.
But what was the best time to make my move? Rather than
insert myself into their conversation while they were happily
chatting, I thought I should wait until that conversation died down
a bit.
While I was observing the two girls, another voice called out
to me from behind.
“Good morning, Ayanokouji-senpai.”
It was Nanase Tsubasa, the girl who was with Housen the
other day. She was now the third first-year I’d seen today, and she</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_138">
<p>was giving me a sunny smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_139">
<img src="https://cote12.ct.ws/13.jpg">
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_140">
<p>“Oh, hey. Morning.”
I hadn’t expected someone to come up and try to talk to me,
so there was a bit of an awkward pause.
“Do you need something from those two girls? Would you
like me to talk to them?” said Nanase, suggesting she reach out to
them on my behalf.
Nanase was a first-year student, too. If she did call out to
those girls, it was highly likely I’d end up talking to all three of
them at once. That would be an even greater hassle.
“Nah, it’s okay,” I replied.
“Oh, really?” said Nanase curiously. She walked by me, just
about keeping pace.
Just as I was trying to figure out how to approach those
other two girls, I’d unexpectedly started up a conversation with
Nanase. I was extremely grateful she’d saved me the hassle of
trying to talk to somebody, but…
There was no way a first-year student coming up to talk to
me was a coincidence. It was quite possible she’d been waiting for
me to come to school, timing her move just right. And that
possibility didn’t just apply to Nanase, but any and every first-year
student who took the initiative to come up and talk to me. Just like
Amasawa yesterday, she was a student who’d approached me,
rather than the other way around.
“I apologize for Housen-kun’s rudeness the other day,” said
Nanase.
“Nah, no worries. He didn’t do anything to me. There’s no
need to apologize,” I told her.
“Still, that doesn’t change the fact that he caused trouble for
you. Even though I was there to stop Housen-kun from doing
things like that, I’m now keenly aware that I’m, well, powerless,”
said Nanase.
Unlike the wild, aggressive Housen, she was extremely
personable and spoke in a polite manner. Her highly preferable
attitude, combined with the fact that she had a B in academic</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_141">
<p>ability, made her a fantastic candidate for a partner. It wouldn’t
have been surprising if she’d been scouted by people other than
me. But here we were, on the third day of the exam period, and
she still hadn’t partnered with any second-year students.
However, that was probably due to Class 1-D’s policy. Aside
from her academic ability, she had scores of C+ or greater in
physical ability, adaptability, and societal contribution. Very well-
balanced scores. At first glance, I couldn’t see anything about her
that remotely resembled a flaw.
Which was exactly what begged the question of why Nanase
Tsubasa was placed in Class D.
Basically, the idea of Class D was that students who were
assigned to it tended to have some kind of problem. For example,
people like Yousuke and Kushida might appear perfect on the
surface, but when you dug deeper, you realized that wasn’t the
case. Meaning I couldn’t deny the possibility that Nanase also had
hidden problems of her own. However, there was also no
guarantee that this year’s batch of Class D students would
necessarily follow the same trend.
Personally, I didn’t mind if someone had a few problems with
their personality or their values. Whether I asked her to be my
partner or my collaborator, the only important thing was whether
Nanase was on Tsukishiro’s side or not. I was concerned about the
look she gave me when I met her for the first time the other day,
when she was with Housen, but…that look was gone, now. The
way she looked at me now seemed normal.
“Have you decided on a partner for the upcoming special
exam?” I asked her, deciding to press forward to try and find out
more about the person known as Nanase.
“Me? No, I haven’t decided yet,” she replied.
“So, have people been coming up to you, to ask?”
“Yes, they have. So far, I’ve been approached by
upperclassmen from Class A and Class C,” said Nanase.
As expected of someone who had a B in academic ability. It
seemed like people had been talking to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_142">
<p>“Why haven’t you agreed to partner up with anybody?” I
asked.
I didn’t know if it honestly had to do with academic ability, or
if it was about points, but decided to press the matter anyway.
“I’m sorry, but I can’t answer that,” Nanase apologized,
bowing her head.
“No, you don’t have to answer any questions that you don’t
want to. There’s nothing to apologize for.”
It didn’t seem likely I’d get any answers about whether this
was a personal problem on Nanase’s part or a problem with Class
1-D at this stage. In that case, I figured I’d try attacking this
situation from a slightly different angle.
“If it’s okay with you, how about we have both our classes
work together to help find suitable partners? Class D to Class D?” I
suggested.
The proposal I made included finding a partner for myself.
Horikita also considered Class 1-D the key to this exam, and
Housen seemed to harbor some kind of feelings towards Class 2-D.
It probably wasn’t a bad suggestion.
“Have our classes…cooperate with one another?” said
Nanase.
“Yeah. A lot of students are trying to team up with people
who are academically gifted for the sake of getting good scores on
this test. But if they do that, the students who struggle
academically won’t get picked, and a lot of them will be left
behind. If the students who struggle academically pair up together,
those students will be in danger of being expelled. That includes
both us second-years and you first-years,” I reasoned.
“Yes. I understand that. I’d like to avoid that happening as
well, if possible,” said Nanase.
“Yeah. In order to make sure that doesn’t happen, we need a
proper balance. Even though we won’t be able to secure one of
the top spots, we need to find partners who can make sure no one
gets a failing grade.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_143">
<p>We were Class D. In terms of public image, we were by far
the worst off. Which was exactly why Class 1-D, which had the
same position as us in the hierarchy, should be likely to agree to
this proposal.
“What do you think?” I added.
“I agree with you. I would like to cooperate with you,
Ayanokouji-senpai, if possible. It’s just…” said Nanase.
“It’s just?” I repeated.
“I don’t know how many of my classmates would be willing
to lend a hand. And on top of that, some of the students who are
more confident in their academic abilities are already in the
process of deciding who their partners will be, privately,” said
Nanase.
Many of the students who could be major players in this
exam and really help with our efforts were instead looking for solid
partners of their own, aiming to get top scores on the exam. The
two girls walking up ahead of me fit that description to a tee. The
reason that students hadn’t settled on a partner yet was probably
because of other issues, like points.
After all, the important thing to know about this test was that
the top thirty percent of scorers would be rewarded. So, the act of
rescuing students with poor grades meant throwing away your
chances at those rewards.
“We don’t exactly need everyone to cooperate though. If we
coordinate things well, we should be able to make it through this
special exam just fine,” I said.
Even if some of the students had already set up
partnerships, it wouldn’t be a major problem.
“That’s true. However, it’s not as though there are no other
problems.” Nanase seemed to agree with the core idea of my
proposal, but she had a grim look on her face. I didn’t need to
think hard about the reason why. I could see it.
“You mean… Housen, I think his name was, right? It sure
seems like he’s a major player in Class D.” I pried further into the
internal affairs of Class 1-D, bringing up something that I was</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_144">
<p>almost completely certain about, thanks to the interaction I had
with Shiratori the other day.
“Yes. Many of the boys and girls in our class have already
started obediently following Housen-kun’s orders,” said Nanase.
So what was once just speculation had now become
certainty. It seemed Housen had already seized control of his class
and was trying to keep it in his grasp. Which meant their strategy
of blocking partnerships from being easily established might have
been put forward by Housen, too. If that was the case, then
Housen wasn’t just a student with significant strength. He also had
the insight, observational skills, and composure to take stock of
what was going on around him.
“Are you in a kind of a special position or something,
Nanase? I didn’t get the feeling that you were all that subservient
to Housen.”
“That’s because I will never yield to violence,” said Nanase.
Her words were so forceful that it was hard to believe they
came from her mouth, given her appearance. The statement
wasn’t something she threw out there casually. There was
something significant behind it. I thought I sensed something—
maybe confidence—reflected in the frank depths of her eyes.
“Senpai, what…do you think about violence?” she asked.
“What do I think?” I repeated.
“I mean, are you pro-violence or anti-violence?” said Nanase.
If she was looking for my thoughts about Housen’s way of
doing things, then there was only one answer I could give her.
“I suppose if I had to choose between those two answers,
then I would say pro,” I stated, clearly.
I was expecting some kind of immediate reaction after I said
that, but I was met with silence. When I turned my gaze toward
Nanase to check her expression, I noticed that the reserved look
she had moments ago had disappeared. Now, she had the same
eyes as when she looked at me the other day, when she was
walking away with Housen.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_145">
<p>After a couple seconds of waiting, Nanase finally spoke up.
“If I had to pick one, I’d also choose pro.”
I couldn’t sense any emotion behind the response. What
she’d just said could be either the truth or as a lie. Had Housen
acknowledged the force of her conviction to not give into violence,
and placed her by his side?
No… That wasn’t the only reason. Back then, Housen reacted
strongly when Nanase had mentioned “that,” whatever it was.
There was no guarantee whatsoever that Housen was
necessarily a stronger person than Nanase. I was curious about
that, but this probably wasn’t the right time to ask about it. She
didn’t seem like the kind of student who would talk unnecessarily
about things that shouldn’t be said. I shouldn’t carelessly do
anything that might make her even warier.
Should I pull back for the time being? There would probably
be a chance to try again, with Horikita.
“In any case, if Housen’s the one deciding what your class
does, this plan might be difficult to pull off.” I started to ponder the
idea of contacting other classes while still maintaining a good
relationship with Nanase, but…
“Well, um, pardon me, but if you’re all right with it… Would
you like me to try to help set up a meeting?” Nanase offered,
perhaps because she thought my suggestion about forming a
cooperative relationship between our classes was a good plan.
“I really appreciate the offer, but are you sure that’s okay?”
“Yes. But I don’t know how many students will cooperate, so
I cannot make any definitive promises. In the worst-case scenario,
it might just be me. Is that all right with you?” asked Nanase.
Let’s put aside for a moment the question of what I thought
about Nanase. It was important, for the time being, for Horikita
and I to have as many opportunities as possible to develop
connections with Class 1-D, for the sake of our classmates.
“Of course. I’m sure Horikita will be overjoyed, too.”
“Is Horikita-senpai the leader of Class 2-D?”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_146">
<p>“Yeah. She’s the one keeping our class together right now.”
I decided to tell Horikita it would be a good idea to set up a
meeting between both Class Ds, with Nanase’s help. I didn’t know
the best way to go about doing that, though, since talking openly
about it in the classroom would definitely get people’s attention.
“Oh, uh… I might not be able to give you a response
immediately. Is that all right?” said Nanase.
“Yeah, that’s fine. I’ll try to get things set up on my end as
soon as possible.”
“Okay.”
Nanase and I then exchanged contact information, agreeing
to get in touch later.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_147">
<p>5.2
 
AFTER CONFIRMING that Horikita still hadn’t arrived at school, I
decided to wait near the entranceway. I figured it would draw too
much attention if I were to casually start talking to her about this
subject in the classroom.
Shortly afterwards, Horikita showed up. She gave me a
puzzled look, not even considering that I might be there waiting
for her.
“Good morning. Are you waiting for someone?” she asked.
“Yeah, something like that, I guess. She just got here,” I
replied.
“I see,” said Horikita.
She briefly turned and looked over her shoulder. When she
noticed there was no one else around whom I seemed to be
particularly acquainted with, she turned back to me once more.
“Me?” she asked.
“Yeah. There’s something I wanted to run by you really
quick.”
“I’m guessing it must be something important, if you were
standing around waiting for me,” said Horikita.
We started walking.
“Important…? Yeah, I suppose so. I think it could be
important. As it happens, I had the chance to speak with Nanase
Tsubasa, from Class 1-D a little while ago, funnily enough. So I
tried proposing a little something to her class,” I told her.
“Oh? And what kind of proposal would that be?” said
Horikita.
“I thought I’d try bringing up the idea of our classes working
together, Class D to Class D.”
“Knowing you, that’s quite a bold move,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_148">
<p>I was sure Horikita had been agonizing over how to form a
relationship with Class 1-D, herself. I was prepared for her to get
angry with me for going ahead and proposing a partnership
without her permission, but…
“Have you checked the status of Class 1-D’s current
partnership situation?” asked Horikita.
“Yeah. None of them have settled on any partnerships yet.
I’m sure Sakayanagi and Ryuuen are probably putting them on the
backburner as potential candidates, too,” I replied.
It was only natural that they’d focus their attention on high
achievers from the upper-level classes who were willing to
cooperate for a reasonable number of points, rather than the
students from Class D who were asking for an exorbitant sum.
“I’m sure that’s not all, either. It would take a certain amount
of work to comply with Housen-kun’s aggressive policies. I’m sure
that from the perspective of the upper-level classes, dealing with
him would just consume a great deal of extra time and effort,” said
Horikita.
“Maybe.”
“Did you make this proposal to Nanase-san after
understanding the difficulties that would come with trying to
confront Housen-kun? Or did you perhaps reach out to her in the
hopes of forming a collaboration in secret, so that Housen-kun
wouldn’t find out?” asked Horikita.
“What do you think?” I asked.
I deliberately turned the question back around on her,
without really giving her an answer myself. If she was no longer
planning on teaming up with Class 1-D at this point in time, then I
was fine with calling everything off.
“I’ve re-analyzed our situation in this special exam, in my
own way. Would you care to hear me out?” said Horikita.
“I’m not confident I can really give you any pertinent advice,
though.”
“I’m not expecting any.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_149">
<p>Apparently, she just wanted me to hear what she had come
up with. It probably had something to do with what I mentioned to
her today about Class 1-D.
“First of all, when you look at the first-years as a whole, it’s
obvious that the most popular students are the ones with
exceptional academic ability,” said Horikita.
“Yeah. If I remember right, Shiratori said he’d been
approached by both Class 2-A and Class C about drafting an
agreement with him, using points,” I replied.
“But no one among Shiratori-kun and his friends has formed
a partnership yet. I think it’s fair to assume they were unable to
come to a settlement based on points, then. At any rate, the sum
they asked us for, five hundred thousand points, was far too steep
a price,” said Horikita.
When you considered the fact that the reward for placing in
the top five was one hundred thousand points, and the reward for
placing in the top thirty percent was ten thousand points, even
asking for two hundred thousand points was way too much.
“I wonder how many points Hashimoto-kun and the others
offered them,” said Horikita.
“Who knows? But it’s probably safe for us to assume that it
was a far cry from five hundred thousand,” I told her.
It was impossible to know the answer to that, unless you
happened to be the person involved in the negotiations.
“I would guess there probably wasn’t that big a difference
between the offers Class A and Class C made. If I had to say, Class
A’s offer might have been a little smaller,” said Horikita.
She had probably deduced that by checking the OAA app
constantly, up until this morning. Between Class A and Class C,
more students in Class C had finalized their partnerships.
“In terms of public image, Class A naturally has the
advantage over Class C. Most people would choose Class A, unless
there was an enormous difference in the number of points they
were offering. With that in mind, we can guess that Class A is
hoping to snatch up first-year students by leveraging both points</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_150">
<p>and the value of their status as Class A, while on the other hand,
Class C, is offering more points to offset their inferior public image
and win students over,” reasoned Horikita.
I nodded, showing that I agreed with her conclusions.
“But I find Ryuuen-kun’s thought process a little strange. If
you want to win in this exam, then drawing the top-scoring
students over to your side is at least the bare minimum you need
to do. But that would inevitably mean having to compete against
Class A to snatch up talent. And if Class C pits their wallets against
Class A, I can’t imagine Class C would stand a chance of winning.
Trying to shoot for first place in overall scores just seems reckless,”
said Horikita.
Ryuuen had said that he was going to threaten people. But
the truth was that his class didn’t stand a chance of winning that
kind of competition.
“He should be going after the students Class A isn’t
interested in, even if that means lowering his standards a little,” I
replied.
Students who had a B- or even a C+ in academic ability
would do well enough. It would be much safer to shoot for second
place in overall scores.
“Well, I suppose trying to make sense of what he’s thinking
is probably pointless, but… Anyway, I’ll get back on track now. The
remaining class, Class B, is trying to create relationships built on
trust with the first-year students, drawing in people without regard
to academic ability, to save the weak. First-year Class D aside, we
can assume that many students with an academic ability ranking of
D or below have been saved by Ichinose-san,” said Horikita.
She briefly turned around to make sure that no one was
eavesdropping on our conversation. After she made sure no one
was listening in, she continued speaking.
“Which means our current objective is to reach out to the
mid-tier students in each class. The people who have an academic
ability ranking between C+ and B-,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_151">
<p>The students in that range probably wouldn’t be approached
with big offers, and there would probably be quite a few of them
still available. Going after those students while Class A and Class C
were scrambling to snatch up the top-scoring students was a good
move.
“So does that mean you’re retracting your plan of forming a
partnership with Class 1-D?” I asked.
“No. That plan is still on. In fact, if anything, I should say it’s
seeming more and more like the optimal choice for us,” said
Horikita.
“So, you’ll abandon trying to get the average students from
other classes?”
That could certainly be called a drastic decision. Since we
were behind the other classes in our grade level, we needed to
establish a lot of partnerships, as soon as possible.
“It’s not like we’re going to sit around and do nothing, of
course. This might be a somewhat malicious way of doing things,
but I intend to pretend to play the money game in order to buy us
some time. The mid-tier students think they aren’t going to get
tempting offers of huge sums of points, unlike the high-achievers.
In that case, we’ll give those students a little taste of what it feels
like to be desired. We’ll make them think that they can do a little
haggling of their own,” said Horikita.
“You mean your goal is to make Sakayanagi and Ryuuen
have to spend their points not just on acquiring the top-scoring
students, but on getting the mid-tier students, too?”
“Well, I’m skeptical about just how effective it’ll be, but I
figure I can probably draw some of their attention that way. And in
the meantime, I intend to cut a path into Class 1-D. Which is
exactly why what you’re telling me now is just what I wanted to
hear. I’ve been thinking of contacting Nanase-san myself,” said
Horikita.
“But isn’t Housen exactly the person who wants to play the
money game?”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_152">
<p>“Yes, that’s certainly true. But I have to wonder, are points
really all he’s after? When he came up to the second-year floor, he
said, and I quote, ‘You can’t even form pairs unless we pick you.
So, I figured, hey, I’ll lend you incompetent, braindead morons a
hand.’ Which means his goal is our class. Would he have really
phrased it that way if he was only after points?”
Horikita asserted that there should be some room for
negotiation, aside from using Private Points.
“The fact that he purposefully said, ‘See you later,’ directly to
me just before he left seemed to indicate something, too.”
“Yeah, that’s certainly true. I think it’s safe to say that
Housen only has his sights on our class,” I replied.
In exchange for giving up on trying to secure the top spots,
Horikita had set three core principles: “No one will get expelled,”
“We’re not participating in the money game,” “Aim for third place
or better in overall scores.” It wasn’t an easy task, but that was
exactly why we were focusing on Class 1-D.
“At any rate, Housen-kun is certainly not going to be easy to
deal with through ordinary methods. I have a backup plan.”
Apparently, Horikita had devised some plans I didn’t know about.
“I’m currently in talks with some people in Class 1-B about setting
up a collaborative partnership.”
“Wait, speaking of 1-B… Do you mean you talked with the
guy who went to the same junior high you and Kushida went to?
Yagami?” I asked.
I thought back to what I saw in the OAA app this morning
after it updated. How Kushida and Yagami had confirmed
partnerships.
“Kushida-san and Yagami-kun partnered up together
yesterday. Unfortunately, I don’t remember anything about any of
the students younger than me at my old school, but he could be
important. He seemed to place a good deal of trust in Kushida-san.
And we’ve already been negotiating with him behind the scenes.
Hopefully, if things go well, we can find more collaborators,” said
Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_153">
<p>Though this was good news, there was something that
worried me.
“Are you giving Kushida instructions?” I asked.
Given how much Kushida hated Horikita, I wasn’t sure how
seriously Kushida would try to help us.
“I’m well aware of how difficult that would be for me, all
things considered. Which is why I’m working through Hirata-kun as
a go-between,” said Horikita.
“I see. I suppose Kushida can’t afford to slack off then.”
If Kushida’s negotiations with Yagami resulted in even just a
few students being brought over to our side, it would mean some
of our partnership problems would be solved, and we could focus
more on studying.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_154">
<p>5.3
 
“GOOD MORNING, Horikita-san. Do you have a minute?”
asked Yousuke, coming over to Horikita’s seat after first period
ended and the break began.
I could see what was happening from my own seat, more or
less.
“I went around and talked to a few people yesterday, but it
seems I can’t really get anyone to work with us that easily, after
all. There were some kids who said they’d consider teaming up
with us, but, well…” said Yousuke, trailing off.
Even though he talked to people who played soccer, just like
him, it sounded like things hadn’t gone so smoothly. Besides, no
matter how good Yousuke was, it would be difficult to get first-year
students who had only just joined the club to really open up.
“The first-years asked for points, didn’t they?” asked Horikita.
Yousuke nodded. Horikita continued speaking.
“Well, they have the chance to sell themselves for a high
price, so I suppose that’s not surprising.”
Just as we had imagined, the problematic point buyout idea
was running rampant all throughout their entire grade level.
“They told me they were approached by Class 2-A, wanting
to partner with them. And that Class C came asking to partner with
them too, in exchange for points. It wasn’t just the kids I talked to,
either. From the sounds of it, almost every single student who got
approached by Class A also got an invitation from Class C, too,”
said Yousuke.
“I suppose that’s only natural, considering the competition
over who gets the smart kids is quite stiff.” Horikita had already
predicted this would happen. However, the words that came out of
Yousuke’s mouth next were not what she expected.
“But apparently, even some of the kids with C and D ratings
have been approached. I heard some stories about how the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_155">
<p>invitations came with offers of pretty hefty sums of points, too,”
said Yousuke.
“Meaning they’re not necessarily prioritizing the students
who are more capable academically?” said Horikita.
“As far as I can tell, yeah,” said Yousuke.
“I see. If you can remember any specific names, could you
share those with me?”
“Of course.”
Yousuke proceeded to list off names of first-year students
who were known for a fact to have received invitations from Class
A. Horikita looked up their names in the OAA app, and quickly
understood what was going on. The students who were being
invited excelled in some other area, even if their academic abilities
weren’t so great. They were valued for their high physical ability
rating, or for their adaptability rating or societal contribution rating.
“I see… Well, actually, I expected as much,” said Horikita.
“Maybe they’re looking ahead to the future, and not just
focusing on short-term results, then,” said Yousuke.
This wasn’t necessarily the only special exam where we’d be
cooperating with the first-year students. If there were more
instances where we had to work together, we might need skills
other than academics at the time. Save the students who had
concerns about their academic prowess, and make use of them
later in their field of expertise—I was sure that was what Class A
was thinking.
That being said, it was interesting that even Class C, led by
Ryuuen, was doing the same thing. They weren’t just going after
students with a high level of academic ability. They were following
in Sakayanagi’s footsteps, right behind her.
“It would be great if we could do the same, but, well…” said
Yousuke, trailing off.
“That would be difficult, I know,” replied Horikita, finishing
his thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_156">
<p>We were Class D. Sakayanagi was Class A. Even the kids who
had only just started attending this school already knew which
class had the better reputation. When considering their future, it
was only natural that they’d favor the superior class, which could
help them out more.
“Thank you. Can you keep looking into things for me?” asked
Horikita.
“Sure. If I find anything, I’ll be sure to let you know.”
Yousuke gave Horikita a bright, cheerful smile and then
returned to his seat. Shortly afterward, I got an instant message
from Horikita.
“So, there you have it.”
It seemed like Horikita had sensed that I was eavesdropping
on her conversation with Yousuke.
“Hirata-kun certainly is dependable, isn’t he?” she added.
“For sure,” I replied.
He and Horikita had gotten into a spat once before, but that
was in the past now. Yousuke worked tirelessly for the sake of the
class, making him very dependable. His communication skills and
high intelligence were assets, of course, but his greatest strength
was his high degree of trustworthiness. He had a great track
record. If Yousuke was involved, people believed he had things in
hand. That was exactly why Horikita was willing to discuss her
strategy with him so openly.
“We’re at a disadvantage just because we’re Class D. It’s
going to be a tough road ahead,” said Horikita.
“Even so, we gotta make do. Good luck.”
“You do realize you have a part to play too, right?”
“You mean the thing with Nanase?”
“Yes. I’d like a response as soon as possible. Tell her that
we’re ready to go whenever she is.”
So, she was saying we ought to move quickly and seal the
deal. To strike while the iron was hot, as they say. After all, if we</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_157">
<p>didn’t, the other classes would keep taking more and more of the
best people out there.
“It’ll probably be the day after tomorrow, though. I have to
take care of that other problem first,” I replied.
“Of course. I know that,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_158">
<p>5.4
 
CLASS ENDED for the day, and we still hadn’t gotten a
response from Nanase yet. Even if she did respond now and tell
me we were on for today, Horikita and I wouldn’t be able to do
anything. There was a more immediate problem that I urgently
needed to take care of—namely, the rather sudden promise we’d
made Amasawa the other day, to serve her a home-cooked meal.
If I managed to score a passing grade, then we could get her
to partner up with Sudou. An extremely enticing offer. But the
hurdle I had to clear was by no means low.
When I arrived at the entrance of Keyaki Mall ten minutes
prior to the scheduled time of our meeting, it seemed Amasawa
wasn’t around yet. So I just stood there, not bothering to check
my phone or anything, but just nonchalantly watching the students
come and go. Students of all grade levels came into the shopping
mall, talking about this or that while they walked around.
The temperature this morning was a little higher than
normal, but as evening approached, it gradually got cooler. It
seemed the temperature was going to drop a little more at
nighttime. Eventually, just when it was about the time we had
agreed to meet, Amasawa appeared.
“Perfect, Ayanokouji-senpai,” she said as she approached me
with a big smile, nodding several times, as if she were satisfied
about something.
“What are you talking about?” I asked.
“You waited at the place you were supposed to, before the
girl got there. And you didn’t even like, do anything else, either”
said Amasawa.
She was unexpectedly sharp. Or rather, I should say she
understood my actions quite well, even the trivial ones. When she
said I didn’t do anything else, she probably meant that I wasn’t
messing around on my phone or calling anyone while I waited.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_159">
<p>Soon, Amasawa would put me to the test. Meaning, I had to
serve her a meal. When I considered that fact, I supposed I could
have spent the time I stood around waiting for her to look up
various kinds of recipes, trying to devise a plan at the last minute.
But, if I had to express it in a way that was easy to
understand, that would be like staring intently at your textbook
right up until the bell rang on the day of a written test. Of course,
looking up information on my phone wouldn’t have violated any of
the rules Amasawa had set. However, it probably would’ve made
me appear like someone who wasn’t confident in his cooking.
The same went for making a call, which would make her
think that I was seeking someone’s help. Therefore, I deliberately
chose to do nothing to make it appear as though I were cool and
collected. I had intended to try to implant that impression into
Amasawa’s subconscious mind, but she had detected what I was
doing right off the bat.
“Well then Ayanokouji-senpai, shall we?” said Amasawa,
lining up next to me, and quickly taking me into the mall with her.
“To buy ingredients, right?”
“Yep! Well, that too. You gotta buy the stuff for what you’ll
make for me. Do you have any cash?” asked Amasawa.
“A reasonable amount.”
In truth, I really didn’t have that much. But I wasn’t going to
say anything excessive in front of an underclassman.
“Ooh, yay! I won’t be shy then, in that case. Um, let’s see, I
think I’ve heard from my classmates that they sell all the essentials
here and stuff, but… I wonder where they keep the shopping
baskets?” said Amasawa.
Rather than heading straight for the supermarket, she
headed over toward “Humming,” a store that specialized in
carrying everything you needed at home. She picked up a blue
shopping basket that she found near the entrance to the store.
What she said earlier, “that too,” stuck in the back of my mind. I
knew I was going to cook a meal for her later, but did that mean</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_160">
<p>there was something else I needed to do besides buy the
ingredients?
Amasawa stopped by the kitchenware section of the store.
When I first started at this school, I’d come by here a few times to
buy the things that I needed. Aside from students, the teachers
and other adults who worked in the café and the cafeteria and
such also needed these products, so there was a particularly large
section of the store dedicated to kitchenware. I remembered not
being able to find what I was looking for right away when I first
came here.
It seemed like all sorts of new products had hit the market
since I’d been here last, which was some time ago. Considering
the fact Amasawa had stopped here, I wondered if she was
planning to buy some kind of special appliance or utensils. There
were countless tools here after all, like peelers, graters, mortars
and pestles, etc. Some of those things, of course, I didn’t have.
What I found strange was that Amasawa never asked me
what tools or utensils I already had. It would’ve made sense for us
to at least discuss what I already had and didn’t have. If she were
worried about losing time, we would have had plenty of time to
talk about it while we walked around, but I held back my desire to
check with her, choosing to let Amasawa run the show for now.
Instead, I tried to bring up a topic that had nothing to do
with cooking utensils.
“Do you not cook for yourself, Amasawa?” I asked.
“Me? Oh, I don’t think I’ve ever cooked before. I’m not the
kinda person who really cooks and stuff. I’d rather be fed than
feed someone else,” explained Amasawa.
Just then, she stopped in her tracks, apparently having
arrived at her intended destination. The process so far had gone
incredibly smoothly. Amasawa looked away from me, towards\ the
shelves of merchandise. She crossed her arms and pondered
something for about half a minute, as if struggling to decide
something. Then she must have come to a decision because she
muttered, “All right,” to herself and nodded.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_161">
<p>“Okay, so, first of all, we’re gonna need a cutting board,
right? Then, like, a kitchen knife? Then we’re gonna need a bowl,
a whisk, and then also, also, we’re gonna need a pot and a ladle,”
said Amasawa, throwing the items into the basket one after
another as she listed them off.
The last item she tossed into the basket was a big spoon.
Apparently, it was called a ladle. I had a hunch that something was
off.
“Wait, hold on a second. I pretty much have almost all of
those things in my room already though,” I told her hurriedly.
“Oh, no worries, no worries! I’m just having you buy these
things for me. For when you cook for me,” said Amasawa.
She was just having me get all these for her…? Even the
cutting board she picked out was much better quality that the one
I had back in my room. It looked like it was made from Japanese
cypress and it cost a little over four-thousand points. The rest of
the cooking utensils she picked out were high-quality items, too.
It seemed she still had other items to cross off her list,
because she moved over to check out the next set of shelves. As
soon as she got there, she picked up a fruit knife without a
second’s hesitation.
“For someone who claims to be a good cook, having a good
petty knife is a must, right?” said Amasawa in a somewhat casual
tone before tossing the item into her basket.
I was a total amateur who had no idea that fruit knives were
called petty knives. Oh, and by the way, the petty knife was also a
high-priced item, coming in at nearly three thousand points. Even
though there were several cheaper options right there on the shelf
next to the item she’d picked up, she didn’t pay any attention to
them. As far as I could tell, the only differences were whether they
included a sheath and whether they were made in Japan.
Once again, the product she’d chosen was quite an
extravagant one. Apparently, people skilled in the art of cooking
were expected to have mastered handling small kitchen knives like
these.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_162">
<p>“Hey, uh, just asking, but who is paying for these…?”
I asked.
“Oh, come on, you are, of course, Ayanokouji-senpai!
Obviously,” she replied.
I already knew that. But the total cost of all these items
easily exceeded fifteen thousand points. I supposed that meant I
might as well just throw away the cheap stuff I was using now. If I
thought about the fact that I could use this high-quality cookware
when I cooked for myself in the future, maybe it would help me
stomach this?
“Oh, and I already told you this just a bit ago, but remember,
you’re buying these to use them for me, and for me only. So don’t
go wearing them out with everyday use, okay?” said Amasawa.
“Are you some kind of evil demon?” I asked her, vocalizing
my rather unpleasant thoughts.
Unpleasantly enough, it seemed she’d been expecting me to
voice my concerns and say something vulgar in the process.
“If you wanna call it off, it’s okay. You can quit any time,
y’know,” she teased provocatively, while clutching the edge of the
shopping basket.
She was taking ample advantage of the fact that I was in a
vulnerable position and couldn’t refuse. Still, if I thought of this as
a way to get Sudou partnered with an A-rank student, then fifteen
thousand points or so was an incredibly good deal. I just had to
think of it that way.
“No, I understand. I accept all of your conditions, so feel free
to pick out whatever you want, and I’ll buy it,” I told her.
“Do you think I’m a bad girl?”
“No, I don’t.”
Amasawa stared intently into my eyes. Then, she smiled. I
couldn’t tell if that was because she knew something, or because
something was eluding her.
“Then we’re all good, senpai,” said Amasawa.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_163">
<p>And so I had to buy everything, from the pot to the ladle and
everything else. And with the horrifying condition that they all be
used only and exclusively for Amasawa.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_164">
<p>5.5
 
AFTERWARD, we went to the supermarket to buy the
ingredients, which was the main purpose of our coming to the mall
in the first place. In the end, the trip cost me about twenty-
thousand Private Points. Needless to say, this was the first time I’d
ever bought so much stuff. The plastic bags I carried in both hands
were so heavy that the handles were digging into my fingers.
No matter how hard I racked my brain, I couldn’t narrow
down exactly what Amasawa was going to have me make for her.
based on these ingredients. She’d had me buy all kinds of things,
from vegetables to meat to fruit. However, there were some dishes
I could identify as possibilities. For instance, the fact that she had
me buy fish sauce and chili peppers gave me some ideas.
It was just that, well…if she intended for me to use all these
ingredients, that would be fine. But it was also quite possible that
she was mixing in some extra ingredients to fake me out, just to
give me a hard time. Considering the things Amasawa said and did
today, I couldn’t help but suspect that was a possibility. It would
probably be close to impossible for me to narrow down exactly
what she was going to have me do at this current stage.
“All right, that’s everything! Well then, shall we get going
back to your room, senpai?” asked Amasawa.
She sounded as enthusiastic as a girl talking about going to
hang out with her boyfriend in his room. But there was no way I
could feel even a speck of giddiness, myself. After all, if I couldn’t
make a dish that satisfied her, this arrangement would most likely
be broken off. And on top of that, making delicious food for
someone was a rather abstract task. If this was a test where she’d
already made up her mind to fail me, then it would just end up
being a waste of both my points and my time.
However, I had no choice but to quietly accept these
developments for now. I’d never imagined Horikita’s spur-of-the-
moment decision could lead to something so exhausting and
bothersome. I didn’t discuss things like the cost of ingredients</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_165">
<p>beforehand with Horikita and Sudou, but considering my expenses,
I’d like to bring this up to them later. I supposed I’d just tuck that
thought in the back of my mind for the time being.
For now, to help me accept this situation as openly as I
possibly could, I decided to go ahead and ask Amasawa a question
I’d been wondering about.
“Hey, isn’t it kind of strange to want to ask a guy you don’t
even know to cook you a meal and feed you, though? I mean,
wouldn’t someone normally feel a strong sense of opposition to
that kind of thing?” I asked.
That was just my own personal opinion, of course, but I
thought most people would feel very reluctant to do such a thing. I
mean, you didn’t just look at your food. You actually had to put it
in your mouth and swallow it. You’d be concerned about things like
taste and hygiene, and therefore, want to know who was making
your food, how they were preparing it, and so on. As you got to
know a person, a relationship based on trust would form, and
those concerns would gradually fade.
“You think? But isn’t it kinda like eating out at a restaurant? I
mean, you have no idea what goes on in the kitchen at a
restaurant, since the one cooking your meal is a stranger, after all,”
said Amasawa.
Well, it was certainly true that we didn’t know exactly how
food in the school cafeteria was prepared or anything. But while
the restaurant scenario and this situation might seem similar on
the surface, they were quite different in reality.
“But even if they’re only making you a single rice ball,
restaurants strictly adhere to sanitation regulations. That’s
completely different from having some random stranger cook for
you, isn’t it?”
“Really? If anything, I feel like I’d rather be in a situation
where I could see the person cooking right next to me, though.
You can see everything about them then—what they look like, how
they move about, how they prepare stuff, everything. You can
even tell how careful they are about stuff like hygiene. On the
other hand, in some restaurants, you can’t see the kitchen at</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_166">
<p>all, right? I mean, there are some places out there that are super
nasty. They’re so unsanitary that they’ve got bugs and stuff,”
argued Amasawa.
She was saying that if she could actually see the person, she
didn’t care if he was a stranger.
“Besides, I think I’ve got a general idea of how things work
at this school. In the unlikely event that I end up dropping to zero
points, I’d have to pinch pennies to get by, right? But I wouldn’t
have to worry about all that if I get senpai to cook for me,” said
Amasawa.
I see. In other words, if I managed to make something tasty
for her now, she was planning to have me do it again. This wasn’t
a one-and-done situation. Her intention was to make sure she had
a steady meal plan in case of emergency.
As for me, well, I supposed it would be a good opportunity to
improve my cooking skills. But I had to wonder if she’d be willing
to pay for the cost of the ingredients.
“So, can you see where I’m coming from?” she asked.
“More or less,” I replied.
Amasawa flashed a toothy grin. However, I still had my
doubts about whether it was the best thing for her to ask a senior
student, and a boy on top of that, to do something like this for her.
I would think it would be a lot easier for her, down the road, to
make such a request of a classmate or someone of the same sex
whom she was good friends with.
Well, I supposed I shouldn’t complain, since I was going to
benefit from this.
“Anyway, I am like, super particular when it comes to taste,
y’know. So, if it’s not really good, then the deal’s off. Okay?” said
Amasawa.
“Yeah, I know. I know just cooking something isn’t enough
to meet your requirements.”
It certainly wasn’t a low bar for me to cross, but I just had to
do the best that I could. The cooking skills Horikita had taught me
in one night would be vital, though I had to wonder how much I’d</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_167">
<p>really be able to make use of techniques I’d learned in the short
amount of time since we accepted Amasawa’s proposal yesterday.
Even so, Amasawa probably wasn’t an opponent I could
deceive all that easily. I could tell from the ingredients she had me
buy that she was eager to put my skills to the test.
Shortly afterward, we arrived at the dormitory building.
Amasawa placed her palm over her brow, trying to keep the sun
out of her eyes as she looked up at the building.
“I’m actually feeling a little nervous, going into the second-
year’s dorms,” said Amasawa.
Even though she said that, she didn’t look very nervous. If
anything, she looked like she was enjoying herself. Like she was
just going out to have fun, like normal.
“Oh, but I guess the building’s like, exactly the same as
ours,” said Amasawa, giving me her impression after taking a long
look at the exterior of the building and then around the lobby
when we got inside.
“Yeah, I suppose they probably are,” I replied, casually
agreeing with what she said, though I had never once gone to the
dormitory buildings for the other grade levels before.
We got a few looks as we passed some of the students from
the other classes. I suppose that was only natural, since I was
walking with a first-year girl (not to mention the fact I was carrying
tons of groceries). Amasawa casually waved at the senior students
as they passed by, but her doing just drew more eyes to us, so I
wanted her to stop it. I hurriedly went into my room with
Amasawa in tow before any strange rumors got started.
“Thanks for having me! Oh, wow. It’s, like, super tidy in
here. And real clean, too!” said Amasawa.
“Oh, I just cleaned up in a hurry last night, since I was
inviting an underclassman over and all.”
I’d done that so she wouldn’t smell anything that would
make her think I’d practiced cooking in the middle of the night.
Now, then… The next steps were extremely important.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_168">
<p>After I set my book bag and the bags containing the food
and kitchenware on the floor in front of the kitchen, the first thing
I did was start to boil water in the electric kettle. Then I walked
into the living room area with Amasawa and encouraged her to
take a seat. I could have had her sit someplace where she
wouldn’t have been able to see the kitchen, but I deliberately
chose not to do that. It was important I ensure she could see me
from the side if she looked over at me.
“I’ll put on some coffee. You can go ahead and watch TV if
you’d like to,” I told her.
“Thanks, senpai,” said Amasawa.
I proceeded to make her some coffee with the water I had
brought to a boil just a few minutes before. I told her to wait a bit
before drinking it. Amasawa picked up the remote control I’d left
on the table nearby and started randomly flipping through
channels.
While it wasn’t an ironclad plan, there was a reason why the
sound of the TV was very convenient for me. Subtly guiding her to
watch TV and having the remote control placed nearby had been
the right decision.
I headed into the kitchen, showing her I intended to get to
work as soon as possible. If she casually tried to stand right next
to me and monitor what I was doing, I would have had to stop her,
but it didn’t seem she was going to do that after all.
“Oh, and looking stuff up on your phone is against the rules,
’kay?” warned Amasawa, looking over at me.
“Man, you’re strict. I think a lot of people look up stuff on
their phones while they cook nowadays, though.”
“So you’re not feeling confident?” she teased.
“I didn’t say that.”
“Then good. Because in my mind, a good cook is someone
who knows recipes by heart,” said Amasawa.
Even though she hadn’t explained any of that to me
yesterday, I casually went along with it. I’d already predicted it
would be something she looked for.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_169">
<p>“In that case, I’ll put my phone next to my bed,” I told her.
I plugged in the charger cable and set my phone down next
to my bed. Amasawa nodded, a look of satisfaction on her face,
and picked up her cup of coffee.
“I’d like to get this show on the road before it gets too late.
So, what am I making?” I asked her.
“All right, I’ll tell you! What I’m going to have you cook,
senpai, is… tom yum goong!”
“Tom yum goong…?” I replied.
That seemed to explain why she had me buy fish sauce and
chili peppers, since those were considered essential in Thai cuisine.
“Can you do it? Pleeeease, senpai?”
The dish that Amasawa had tasked me with making was tom
yum goong. I had never made it before in my life, of course.
Actually, I’d hardly ever heard about it, let alone tasted it, in the
first place. It wasn’t a dish ever served to us in the White Room. I
had seen on TV that it was popular with women, but that was
about the extent of my knowledge.
If I were to try and make it right now, relying only on my
existing abilities, I’d probably fail. Not only did I not know the
specific ingredients needed to make it, but I also had no idea what
steps were actually involved in preparing everything.
So what exactly had I done all of last night then, you ask?
Well, nothing rash like trying to memorize the recipes of all sorts of
cuisines from every era and country. And I didn’t master basic
cooking techniques, either. Considering there was the possibility
Amasawa might permit me to look at recipes on my phone, it
would’ve been nonsensical for me to spend my time memorizing
recipes.
Once it was decided that I was going to be the one cooking
for Amasawa, Horikita had set two plans of action into motion. The
first part of the plan was to teach me the basics. How to handle
fundamental tools in the kitchen, like knives and such. I spent
most of my time practicing things like slicing, julienning, dicing,</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_170">
<p>and chopping. The techniques that would be more obvious, visual
indicators of your skill in the kitchen.
Of course, my skills were nowhere near the level of a
professional’s. I was, at best, at around the skill level of an
average person who just so happened to know their way around
the kitchen a little. It would be impossible for an ordinary person
to master cooking in just half a day, but I was confident in my
ability to pick up skills quickly. At the very least, I’d probably
gotten to the level of someone who cooked several times a week.
I’d been able to accomplish that precisely because I didn’t
spend even a second on learning things like recipes or how to cook
anything. Of course, that meant there was no way I would know
how to make the dish Amasawa had just tasked me with cooking.
Which was where Horikita’s second plan of action came in. A
way to check the recipe in real time, using a phone. But Amasawa
had forbidden me from looking at my phone, and my poor phone
was being held hostage right by my bedside. Even if I had a tablet
or something at the ready, hidden somewhere, there was a chance
Amasawa might spot it. In fact, she occasionally turned her
watchful gaze over in my direction from time to time.
Those things were all factored into our calculations. I took
something less than two inches long out of my right pocket, which
was in Amasawa’s blind spot. At first glance, it looked like a normal
earplug. I casually inserted it into my right ear, where Amasawa
wouldn’t be able to see it, then cleared my throat, to give a signal.
Horikita’s voice came from the small wireless earphone that I
had inserted into my right ear.
“I’ve heard everything you talked about, loud and clear.
I never imagined she’d ask you to make tom yum goong,” said
Horikita.
The idea was that Horikita, who had free access to her
computer in her room and could look up information, could give
me instructions on how to cook the dish in real time. Sudou’s
phone was inside the bag placed down on the floor by my feet.
And audio streamed from Sudou’s phone to the wireless</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_171">
<p>earphones. I had been on the phone with Horikita since before I
went shopping with Amasawa.
During the time that Amasawa and I were shopping at the
mall, Horikita went back to her dorm room and got everything in
order. The wireless earphone was something we had bought
yesterday. In the unlikely event that Amasawa got up and walked
over to see how I was doing, I could casually pretend to scratch
my head, remove the wireless earphone and put it back in my
pocket. Since I was in a position where Amasawa could easily
observe what I was doing, that meant that I could see what she
was doing, too.
Thanks to all that, I could make this dish without having to
worry about the recipe. We had already worked out several signals
to use in situations like if Horikita went through her instructions
too quickly, or if I needed her to repeat a step. From this point on,
how well Horikita and I communicated over the phone was going
to be extremely important. Even if I knew what ingredients and
utensils I’d be using, I had no visual references to go off of.
I had to cook a dish called tom yum goong somehow, and
left on my own, I would have been at a complete loss. What
remained to be seen was just how well Horikita could give me
specific instructions over the earphone, and how well I could
produce something based on those instructions.
“By the way, there’s something I’d like you to check with
Amasawa-san first,” asked Horikita, who proceeded to tell me her
question through the earpiece.
It would be annoying if Amasawa asked me to make
additional things for her later, so I did as Horikita instructed and
asked her, repeating the question in my own words.
“Amasawa. You don’t need a whisk to make tom yum goong,
and you don’t need to use a Petty knife, either. If you’re going to
ask me to make you something else besides that, I’d like you to
tell me now,” I told Amasawa, with a glare.
“Well, I was gonna ask you later, but I was thinking of having
you peel some apples for me,” replied Amasawa. Apparently, she
had been intending to place an additional order. “The rest of the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_172">
<p>food is stuff for you to enjoy later, senpai. Oh, and as for the
utensils that you don’t use this time around, you can use them the
next time I pay you a visit.”
It sounded like the petty knife was actually going to see
some use today, though I’d originally doubted whether I’d need it
at all. But some of the other things were going to go in storage for
a while.
“Double-checking was the right call, then. I taught you how
to handle the fruit knife the other day. You can manage, right?”
asked Horikita.
I had no idea how well I could apply techniques I’d only
learned overnight, but I figured I’d probably manage just fine.
“Let’s shoot for about fifteen to thirty minutes of cooking
time. Okay?” said Horikita.
Now, then, let’s see just how well I can make this.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_173">
<p>5.6
 
ALTHOUGH IT TOOK SLIGHTLY LONGER than expected, I somehow
managed to make the tom yum goong, just as I had been
instructed. And now the time had come for me to serve the
completed dish to Amasawa. I’d never imagined I’d be serving a
home-cooked meal I made myself to someone I’d only just met.
And a girl, no less.
I placed the tom yum goong on the table and then came
back with an apple in hand. I probably needed to show Amasawa
that I could handle using a Petty knife, right in front of her.
“I normally use a regular kitchen knife to peel stuff, so I’m
not really used to doing it this way. So I might be a little off,” I
said, putting that out there as something of a disclaimer before I
got to work on peeling the apple.
“Wow, awesome! Incredible! You can handle it so well! You
definitely pass on knife skills,” said Amasawa.
I was nowhere close to a professional, but I supposed it
didn’t look like this was the first time I had ever picked up a knife
in my life, at the very least. I laid out the apple slices that I had
finished cutting up.
“By the way, when I think of tom yum goong, I usually think
of cilantro. Do you not like it or something?” I asked her.
Cilantro wasn’t among the items that she had me buy today.
“Hm, well, yeah. I guess? But I figured that if I had you buy
cilantro for me, you would’ve guessed I was going to have you
make tom yum goong,” replied Amasawa.
From the sound of it, she had been on her guard the whole
time then, and deliberately chosen to skip the cilantro. I supposed
that was because she was trying to prevent me from pulling off
any tricks, after all. I could understand why she’d tried to avoid
giving me opportunities to exploit, but it was still pretty excessive.
“Do you mind if I go ahead and start cleaning up?” I asked
her as I brought the cutting board and Petty knife I’d used to cut</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_174">
<p>up the apple back into the kitchen.
“Uh, yes I do mind! You’ve gotta plant your butt right here
and wait for my verdict,” replied Amasawa, directing me to sit
down in front of her.
Since I couldn’t exactly defy her demands, I gave up on
cleaning for the time being, and returned to the living room from
the kitchen, as she had instructed me to do.
“All right. Time to dig in!” said Amasawa, slowly bringing a
spoonful of piping hot tom yum goong to her mouth.
She didn’t seem to have any qualms whatsoever about
having someone watch her eat. But I supposed I was like her in
that regard, as I didn’t mind having people around me, either. At
any rate, once she was done eating, Amasawa slowly brought her
hands together in a gesture to show that she was quite satisfied.
“Thank you for the meal,” she said.
She didn’t seem to have eaten like a bird or anything,
considering the bowl looked like it had been licked clean. But,
well… though I’d tasted the dish myself before I served it, I had no
idea whether the flavor was right. I hadn’t made any mistakes with
the measurements or anything, so I didn’t think there were any
problems. Even so, if Amasawa said she wasn’t satisfied, then this
battle would be over. It would end in our defeat.
“So, senpai, your tom yum goong is…”
Amasawa paused for a moment before giving her judgment.
“Yeah, I guess it’s so-so. It wasn’t particularly tasty or
anything, but it was good enough that I don’t think I’d mind
having it again,” said Amasawa.
She didn’t touch on the thing I was most immediately
concerned about—namely whether I had passed her test.
“Anyway, I’ll help you clean up,” said Amasawa, picking up
the bowl and spoon she had used and heading into the kitchen.
She didn’t just clean up her dishes, for some reason. She
started to actually help me clean up everything, for real.
“I’ll handle it,” I told her.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_175">
<p>“No, no, I’ve got it, really! Besides, I forced you into making
all this for me, so let me do at least this much. Take a seat and
relax, senpai. I’m definitely no cook myself or anything, but I
contribute at home by helping my mom with cleaning up, so I’m
pretty good at that part of the job,” said Amasawa.
“All right, then, I’ll take you up on that. Oh, by the way,
what’s my score? How’d I do?” I asked her.
Amasawa fell silent for a brief moment as she continued to
clean. Only the sound of the evening news on the TV could be
heard throughout the room.
“Oh, yeah, that’s right. I guess I’ve gotta tell you what your
score is. Hm, not sure…” said Amasawa, hesitantly, looking like she
was pretending to think it over.
She must not have liked how the ribbon on the right side of
her hair was sitting, because she kept adjusting it while she
pondered, checking her reflection in her phone, taking the ribbon
off and then putting it back on. Not long afterward, she finished
adjusting her ribbon, and then proceeded to give me her verdict.
“As I just told you a little while ago, it was so-so. The
execution wasn’t bad, and the flavor wasn’t bad either,” said
Amasawa.
“So, I just barely passed then. Wow, harsh.”
“Well, I am very particular when it comes to food, y’know,”
said Amasawa, looking at me with a big smile on her face. “I guess
that means whether I come back here to eat again depends on
how hard you work, senpai.”
I supposed that meant my cooking skills weren’t at the level
where it made her want to drop by and have me cook her a meal
that often, then. Still, “so-so”… That was harsh. I was a little
hesitant to ask her if that meant we failed, but I decided to go
ahead and do it.
“So does that mean we failed? You’re not going to help with
Sudou?” I asked.
“Well, while I can’t really say you passed, it’s true that you
can cook. Still, I need to repay you, since you bought all this</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_176">
<p>expensive stuff for me and you did let me eat for free. So I’ll team
up with Sudou-senpai, in recognition of your efforts, senpai,” said
Amasawa.
It didn’t seem like she was satisfied, exactly, but I’d
apparently just barely managed to meet her standards. Just as I
was starting to think things were going to get difficult, I was met
with welcome news. I breathed a sigh of relief.
“I’ll be done cleaning up in just a bit, so hold on a bit longer,
okay?” said Amasawa.
I couldn’t exactly just sit there and stare at her while she
was hard at work cleaning up, so I just quietly watched the news
playing on the TV while I waited. Amasawa came back out of the
kitchen shortly afterward, so she must have felt like she’d done the
job to her standards. Then, she started fiddling with her phone,
showing me the screen all the while. She submitted a partnership
request for Sudou. As long as Sudou responded to her request
sometime by the end of day, then their partnership would be a
done deal.
“Sudou’s busy with club stuff right now, so I’ll let him know
what’s up later. Is that okay?” I told her.
Of course, the truth of the matter was that Sudou couldn’t
respond right away, since I had his phone.
“Yeah, totally okay. Well, I feel bad for dragging this out so
late, so I’ll head back to my room now. See you later, Ayanokouji-
senpai,” said Amasawa.
Everything had proceeded without a hitch. She moved
toward the exit to head back to her own room.
“Amasawa. I’m grateful to you for pairing up with Sudou.
You’re really doing a big favor for Sudou, and Horikita, too,” I told
her.
“It’s all right, no biggie. But you can go ahead and shower
me with your appreciation still, okay?” said Amasawa flippantly as
she put on her shoes.
“If you don’t mind, there is something else I’d like to ask
you, since I’ve got you here.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_177">
<p>Just as I was about to come out and ask, though, Amasawa,
who’d finished putting her shoes on, turned back to look at me.
“You want to know if I’ll be middleman between our classes,
you mean?” she said quickly, without missing a beat.
Well, it wasn’t like she was in Class A and had an academic
ability ranking of A for nothing. She was quite quick-witted.
“Yeah, exactly. There are lots of people in our class who are
struggling to find partners, like Sudou. If you could introduce us to
even just one student who was willing to help, it’d really be
appreciated,” I told her.
“Sorry, but I think that’s probably a no-go,” said Amasawa,
clasping her hands together and apologizing.
She promptly turned down my request.
“Ah, but it’s not because you or Horikita-senpai did
something wrong, okay? I do think I can trust you guys, y’know.
But, well, I don’t really get along with my classmates all that well.
I mean, when we met up yesterday, I was all by my lonesome,
remember?” said Amasawa.
“Now that you mention it, yeah. You’re right.”
Back then, there’d been lots of students going around the
mall with their friends. But Amasawa was by herself.
“I guess it’s because people say I lack tact or something, or
that I tend to be pretty blunt. It’s kinda hard to make friends with
that kind of personality. Which is why I can’t really help you all that
much. Sorry, okay?” said Amasawa.
“Nah, the fact that you’re partnering up with Sudou for us is
more than enough. If you have any issues, let me know. I might
be able to do something to help.”
“Yeah, okay, thanks! Okay then. See you later! Bye bye!”
While I’d failed to establish a connection with Class 1-A, this
was probably enough for the time being.
“Well, I guess that’s that,” I muttered to myself.
I hung up Sudou’s phone, which had still been on a call this
whole time, then proceeded to call Horikita using my own phone.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_178">
<p>“Good work. It seems things worked out well, somehow,”
said Horikita, words of gratitude coming out of her mouth almost
as soon as I got on the call with her.
“I get the feeling we were saved by Amasawa’s kind-hearted
judgment.”
“Even so, this means that Sudou-kun’s problem has been
solved. That was an excellent outcome,” said Horikita.
It was wrong of us to have used such a dirty trick on
Amasawa, but in the end, it had helped. All we had to do now was
make sure Sudou picked up his phone and accepted the
partnership request before time was up. Considering the time, he’d
probably be showing up any minute now.
“Why did you ask Amasawa-san to act as an intermediary
between our class and Class 1-A, though? Putting aside the matter
of her personality and the number of friends she has, didn’t you
consider it would be difficult to negotiate with them, since we’re
Class 2-D?” asked Horikita.
Horikita had never said anything about trying to work with
Class 1-A as part of her strategy for this special exam, simply
because it was too difficult to build a collaborative partnership with
them.
“I just asked that as a formality. The truth of the matter is
that we’re having trouble finding partners. So it would’ve been
suspicious if I didn’t say something to that effect,” I replied.
If we appeared as though we had no other options, we’d be
giving people the impression we were really grasping at straws
when we talked to them and asked for their help. If we didn’t give
people that kind of impression, but instead made them think we
did have some options, they would suspect we had some other
strategies that we were working towards.
“Meaning… you didn’t want Amasawa to realize that we were
giving up on Class 1-A from the very beginning, and targeting B
and D instead?” said Horikita.
Horikita hadn’t even considered using Amasawa to win her
class over to our side, since she’d already decided to focus on</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_179">
<p>those two other classes. This whole time, she’d only been hoping
to take advantage of the unexpectedly fortunate opportunity that
had fallen into our laps and get a partner for Sudou.
“None of us really know anything about what Amasawa is
actually like. Which is exactly why what happened today could end
up getting out to the rest of the new students, or even to everyone
in our grade level. I took that into consideration. I might just be
worrying too much, though.”
After hearing me say all that, Horikita went silent for a few
moments.
“What’s wrong?” I asked.
“It’s just…your thought process, it’s… How do I put it? It’s
extremely calculating and clever,” said Horikita.
“It’s not really all that big a deal.”
“No, it very much is a big deal. Sure, it sounds obvious when
you spell it out to me like that, but the fact that you thought that
far ahead is a different matter entirely. I’m starting to understand
why my big brother was paying so much attention to you, I think.
But the old you wouldn’t have explained everything to me so
clearly. What happened?” Horikita seemed to have some concerns
about how I was acting, and the possibility that I’d changed.
“I don’t really have an ulterior motive or anything. Anyway,
the next issue is what to do about the remaining students. I’ll let
you know when I hear back from Nanase,” I replied.
“Y-yes, you’re right. I’ll be waiting until I hear from you
then,” said Horikita.
After I got off the phone with Horikita, I decided to check
how things looked in the kitchen. It had been thoroughly tidied up.
Not only had the dishes been washed, even the sink and such had
been carefully cleaned and wiped down. Everything looked as good
as it did when I first came to this room a year ago. The cutting
board, dishes, kitchen knife, Petty knife, pot, ladle, etc., that I had
used had all been neatly put away. Everything looked perfect.
Even though this whole situation had sprung up out of a
proposal Horikita had made, this was the first time I’d interacted</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_180">
<p>so closely with a first-year student. If Amasawa had come from the
White Room, it wouldn’t have been surprising for her to try and
pull something, but I saw no signs of that. I was certainly quite
cautious myself, but I had to wonder.
Considering the way she talked and how she acted, it
certainly seemed like she was a normal high schooler. The kind of
knowledge she had seemed pretty on par, too. If someone had just
left the White Room, it would probably be difficult for them to
behave like Amasawa.
“More importantly, Amasawa got paired up with Sudou. I
suppose that means that eliminates her as a White Room suspect
then, huh?” I asked myself.
That would be my conclusion if I had to make a judgment
based on the information available to me at present, including
what I knew about which other first-year students had already
settled on partners. It was probably too soon to come to such
conclusions, though, regardless of who I was talking about.
It did seem like partnering with me would put me on the fast
track to expulsion, but that being said, it wasn’t the only way the
White Room agent could go about getting me expelled. It was
possible that whoever this person was, they were intentionally
passing up this big chance to get me expelled, this special exam,
in order to find another opening to exploit. Someone couldn’t gain
the kind of knowledge a normal high-schooler would have
overnight, but it was a different story if they were given more
time.
Besides, it wasn’t like there was nothing at all that bothered
me about Amasawa. There were some things she’d said and done
that stuck out to me. It might not be anything I needed to worry
about, but it would be best if I could deal with anything and
everything that gave me cause for concern.
I wasn’t just referring to Amasawa by that, either. I was also
referring to Housen and Nanase, who I’d most likely be coming
into contact with in the future. Out of the many second-year
students around, those two made eye contact with me first, right
away. Any student who came into such close contact with me
should be regarded as suspicious, regardless of whether or not</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_181">
<p>we’d actually had a conversation. And from this point onward, I
was going to be venturing into dangerous territory by searching for
candidates for partners.
Later that night, I received a message from Nanase. It said,
“Let’s meet tomorrow after class.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_182">
<p>5.7
 
THAT VERY SAME DAY, around when Ayanokouji was cooking a
meal for Amasawa, three students from Class 2-A gathered in one
place to have a discussion. They were Sakayanagi, Kamuro, and
Kitou.
“It happened again. It sounds like the students we reached
out to all got invitations from Class C. And on top of that, it sounds
like they’ve been offered ten thousand points just to turn down
any offers from our class, no strings attached,” said Kamuro,
relaying what she was hearing from Hashimoto over the phone.
She added her own thoughts. “Wait, ten thousand points just to
decide not to partner with us? That’s so dumb.”
Class 2-C was offering a hundred thousand points in advance
just to agree to partner up with them. Then, after getting
confirmation of a combined score of five hundred and one points
or more on the test, Class C would offer another hundred thousand
points on top of that, for a total of two hundred thousand points.
“Fu fu. Well, it seems Ryuuen-kun really intends to throw
down the gauntlet with me,” said Sakayanagi.
“So, what are you going to do? Do you want to fight back
using points too?” asked Kamuro.
“Well, if we have a contest of financial power, we’d certainly
win. But don’t you feel like winning through the same strategy as
your opponent lacks a certain artistic quality?” said Sakayanagi.
“A certain artistic quality…? But if we need to be handing out
a hundred thousand or even two hundred thousand points,
shouldn’t we be getting in on this too? I mean, it’s clear that the
new kids think the benefits of getting points is huge,” said Kamuro.
Word had already gone around the school that the new
students were in an advantageous position in this exam. A
standard had been set where the honors students asked for points
in exchange for partnering up with people. After hearing Kamuro’s</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_183">
<p>advice, Sakayanagi simply smiled back at her, but didn’t express
agreement with what she’d said.
“So, what? Are you fine with losing, then? To Ryuuen?” said
Kamuro.
“First of all, there is quite a significant difference in academic
ability between Ryuuen-kun’s class and our own. If he’s going to
make up for that difference with the help of the new students, he’ll
need to draw on quite a few people to do so. And even if he does
manage that, it’s not as though his victory is assured,” said
Sakayanagi.
“Yeah, sure, you might be right about that. But that doesn’t
mean we’re definitely going to win either, does it?” replied Kamuro.
“Correct. Even if Ryuuen-kun were to gather students with
academic ability rankings in the A range, that would make him just
barely capable of competing with us, wouldn’t you say? Even if we
did nothing at all, I would say that our chances of winning would
be a solid fifty percent,” said Sakayanagi.
However, put another way, that also meant they had a fifty
percent chance of losing. It wasn’t like Kamuro was getting heated
up because she particularly wanted to win or anything, though. It
was because she couldn’t possibly believe that Sakayanagi, the girl
sitting right in front of her, would just sit there and do nothing.
“What do you imagine might happen if we said we’d pay out
the same amount?” asked Sakayanagi.
“What would happen? Well, Ryuuen would pay out even
more, yeah?” said Kamuro.
“Exactly. I’m sure he would probably increase what he was
offering to two hundred or three hundred thousand points,” said
Sakayanagi.
“But if we tried to outbid him, we could definitely get the
smartest kids on our team,” countered Kamuro.
“And the cost of doing so would be a fair number of points.
There’s really no need for us to deliberately risk losing millions of
points. Don’t you agree?” said Sakayanagi.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_184">
<p>“So, what, are you saying we can snatch up students even if
we offer them less? I can’t really imagine the new kids are going
to have a deep understanding of Class A’s reputation, though,”
snapped Kamuro, though Sakayanagi still showed no signs that she
was going to engage in a bidding war at all.
“I can tell quite clearly that Ryuuen-kun is determined to win
first place overall. He seems to have completely changed his policy
from last year, when he was simply out for money, like when he
made that arrangement with Katsuragi-kun,” said Sakayanagi.
“He was planning on saving up twenty million points so he
could win himself, right?” said Kamuro.
“He’s undergone quite a significant change of heart, it
seems. He’s realized the importance of Class Points. Well, no. I
suppose I should say it’s more that he’s changed gears to make
sure his class wins,” said Sakayanagi.
Sakayanagi and Ryuuen hadn’t had a single face-to-face
interaction during this special exam yet. However, it almost
seemed as though they were discussing things with one another,
bouncing strategies off of each other.
“So… you’re fine with this? With not offering to pay up
Private Points?” asked Kamuro.
“Oh, my, Masumi-san. I don’t recall ever once saying I wasn’t
going to be using points, hm?”
“Huh? But didn’t you just say that competing by using points
lacks a certain artistic quality or whatever?”
“I’d like you to pass a message to the new students. Tell
Hashimoto that we’re prepared to match Ryuuen-kun’s offer,” said
Sakayanagi.
Kamuro pursed her lips at this puzzling order.
“However… even if the first-year students agree to our offer,
please do not tell them the deal is sealed,” added Sakayanagi.
“Huh? Wait, what? I seriously am not understanding what’s
going on here,” replied Kamuro.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_185">
<p>“Fu fu fu. Ryuuen-kun, your strategy is actually quite
convenient for me,” said Sakayanagi to no one in particular.
“For the love of… I have no clue what’s what anymore,”
sighed Kamuro.
“Ah come on, what’s the harm? If the princess says we gotta,
then we just gotta do what we’ve gotta do, right,” replied
Hashimoto over the phone in an amused tone, having been
listening in on the conversation the whole time.
“…I mean, I guess it’s fine, whatever,” said Kamuro.
Sakayanagi had instructed her followers not to confirm
partnerships, even if they found first-years who agreed to accept
the set number of points they were offering. Kamuro couldn’t wrap
her head around what it all meant, but she passed the instructions
on to Hashimoto, word for word.
Sakayanagi, looking over at Kamuro almost lovingly, seemed
to feel a little sorry for behaving too meanly earlier. She started to
explain her reasoning, giving her a few hints.
“Ryuuen-kun’s strategy of engaging in an extravagant deal-
making spree isn’t necessarily a bad one. By deliberately going
around and striking up so many deals with students, he’s
succeeded in forcing me to engage with him in a bidding war.
However, targeting the same students we already contacted,
making us directly compete to recruit them, was a clear error on
his part. Since Class C is inferior in terms of overall ability, he
should be focusing solely on students with a high level of academic
ability,” said Sakayanagi.
However, Ryuuen wasn’t doing that. He wasn’t just trying to
reach out to the high achievers, but also to students that Class A
was going to need in the future. Students who had skills in areas
other than academics.
“Does that mean that he’s got a ton of Private Points saved
up or something?” asked Kamuro.
“Well, I have to wonder about that. Even if he does have the
minimum points required to pull this strategy off saved up, the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_186">
<p>number of points he can actually move around might not be all
that significant. Understand?” replied Sakayanagi.
“Wait, no, that’d be crazy though. He can only make offer
after offer to all these kids because he’s got the points, right?”
“But you can make all the offers you like, even if you don’t
have a single point. He only needs to pretend he has the points on
hand.”
Kamuro didn’t immediately understand what Ryuuen stood to
gain by doing such a thing.
“If it weren’t for Ryuuen-kun, we could have successfully
brought quite a number of talented new students over to our side
by using our class’s reputation alone. However, he has forced us to
engage in a bidding war by trying to buy these students out. And
what will he do next? He’ll try to raise the stakes even higher. Try
to make us pay lavish sums, as much as we can possibly spend,”
said Sakayanagi.
“I see… Huh, so that’s it, then.”
Even if Class A ended up nabbing the most talented students
for themselves, the fact that they would be forced into paying two
or even three hundred thousand points would work to Class C’s
benefit when it came to the competition between the second-year
classes.
“But we’re at a disadvantage right now, aren’t we? I mean,
he’s been pulling off one success after another,” said Kamuro.
“There’s no need for us to panic at this stage. Some students
have been bought up by Ryuuen-kun, that’s all. We can let him
feel like he’s winning, feel like he’s got a feather in his cap. He’s
made a few errors in judgment. Namely, he underestimates the
power of Class A’s reputation. He thinks it can be nullified if we
were to stumble. And he’s under the misapprehension that he can
get any number of collaborators over to his side if he offers them
enough money,” said Sakayanagi.
“I don’t really get it, but everything will work out as long as
we do what you’ve told us, yeah?” said Kamuro.
“Yes. That’ll be enough for now,” said Sakayanagi.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_187">
<p>“I don’t really like this. I feel like we’re being forced to play
along with Ryuuen’s plans. If we keep getting dragged into the
messes he creates, I’m not sure what’s gonna happen.”
“Please do not worry. It won’t come to that. We’re going to
win this game without any problems.”
Kamuro let out a sigh, once again finding herself unable to
wrap her head around what Sakayanagi was telling her.
“There’s no point in trying to rack your brain over it at this
point in time, so please don’t let yourself get riled up by Ryuuen-
kun. This special exam is nothing more than a prelude. We’re both
trying to sound each other out right now, while also keeping each
other in check,” said Sakayanagi.
“I can’t wrap my head around any of this. I think I’m about
ready to give up,” said Kamuro.
“But… If at all possible, I’d prefer this didn’t end in Ryuuen’s
self-destruction. It’s really no fun to finish this so easily,” said
Sakayanagi.
She looked out the window, praying that the enemy coming
after her was worthy of being her opponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_188">
<p>5.8
 
ON THAT VERY SAME DAY, just two hours after Sakayanagi and
Kamuro had their discussion, Ryuuen sat with Ishizaki and Ibuki in
one of the karaoke rooms.
“Seems like the Class 1-B kid we were hopin’ to snatch up for
two hundred thousand has put our offer on hold, Ryuuen-san,”
said Ishizaki, reporting his findings to Ryuuen after checking his
phone.
“The hell? What, is two hundred large not enough to satisfy
’em or something?” said Ryuuen.
“Well, uh, it seems like Sakayanagi said Class 2-A will offer
the same number of points, so…” Ishizaki trailed off.
“They don’t wanna lose to us. How can we even win if we
keep playing this game? We’re at a disadvantage,” said Ibuki.
“I think Class A has a bunch of points. So yeah, we probably
are at a pretty big disadvantage…” added Ishizaki.
Even after hearing that news, Ryuuen simply fiddled around
with his phone. He didn’t seem to be panicking at all.
“R-Ryuuen-san?” asked Ishizaki.
“Relax. I already know everythin’ they’re up to,” said Ryuuen.
He shot a glance toward his empty glass, which prompted
Ishizaki to hurriedly fill it back up with water.
“Tell these kids we’ll pay ’em a hundred thousand up front,
plus another two hundred after the exam,” said Ryuuen.
“D-dude, seriously?” balked Ishizaki.
A total of three hundred thousand. The number of points
being thrown around had grown even greater.
“Most of the newbies probably aren’t gonna come to a
decision, though. They’re gonna be waitin’ for Sakayanagi’s
counteroffer,” said Ryuuen.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_189">
<p>“Wait, aren’t we basically nuking ourselves by doing this?”
said Ibuki.
If they became short on funds, then there’d be nothing else
they could do.
“Maybe it’s hopeless to compete against Sakayanagi after
all… Maybe we ought to try goin’ for second place…” added
Ishizaki.
“I think so, too. Even if we had the same number of points to
throw around, we’d lose in terms of our class’s reputation,” said
Ibuki.
After hearing Ishizaki and Ibuki analyze the situation, Ryuuen
laughed. “Ha! I’m bettin’ that Sakayanagi chick probably has a
smug grin on her face right now, thinkin’ she’s won.”
“She’s just seen right through what you’re doing. Even if you
could actually compete with her using Private Points, there’s still
the difference in our reputation,” said Ibuki.
“Meh, Class A’s reputation is all show right now, nothin’
more. Considering how much those guys depend on their
reputation, the amount of trust they’ll lose when that reputation
falls apart is gonna be unfathomable,” said Ryuuen.
“Okay, but even if that’s true, what about the points? I mean,
I guess if the offers balloon all the way up to three or four hundred
thousand, that won’t be too bad, but there’s no way we can pay
everyone,” countered Ibuki.
“Ain’t no need to pay. I ain’t planning on giving anything to
these punk kids who keep askin’ for more and more, like the sky’s
the limit,” said Ryuuen.
“…Huh?”
“I ain’t planning on forkin’ over any points. I’m sussing out
exactly what kinda people these new kids are. You know what they
say—money talks. But the people who are willing to cooperate if
you put up the cash are the people you can bring over to your side
any time. When you really need ’em to help out, just pay ’em, and
that’s that. The real important people are the ones who intuitively
understand the things other than points,” said Ryuuen.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_190">
<p>“I’m sorry, I’m totally not gettin’ any of this…” said Ishizaki.
“Sakayanagi probably thinks I’m after first place overall. But I
never planned on goin’ after such a pitiful number of Class Points
from the start. If we’re gonna completely crush Class A, we’ve just
gotta wait for the right time. The time when Class Points are really
gonna fluctuate wildly, way more than now,” said Ryuuen.
“So, does that mean that you did all of this just to find out
which of the new kids would roll over for points?” said Ishizaki.
“It was obvious from the start that we could fish for brats
with points, if we offered more. But there are already some kids
who have partnered up with us. Why do you think they chose to
partner up with Class C?” asked Ryuuen.
“Huh… Yeah, actually, now that you mention it, I gotta
wonder. Why?” asked Ishizaki.
The first offer that Ryuuen had made was for fifty thousand
paid up front, plus an additional fifty thousand after the exam. But
even though that offer wasn’t too high, some students had already
accepted it and joined forces with Class C.
“That reminds me. You always did meet one-on-one with
people when you were making a partnership agreement legit…
Were you threatening them or something?” asked Ibuki.
“Well, yeah, a little. You’re right on that count,” said Ryuuen.
So, the students, after being lured in by a generous sum of
three or four hundred thousand points, would fold after being
interviewed by Ryuuen. In the end, the agreed-upon price was far
less expensive than it appeared to be on the surface.
“I’m screenin’ the new kids to see if they can understand
that I’m better than Sakayanagi,” said Ryuuen.
He was selecting people who could instinctively identify the
winning class without factoring points or reputation into the mix.
Those were the people Ryuuen was really looking for in this special
exam.
He was looking far into the future, well past the next year.
His goal was to take Sakayanagi and the rest of Class A down.</p>

<p class="chapter">Chapter 6:</p>
Class D and Class D
 
IT WAS NOW THURSDAY, and the weekend was drawing near.
After class ended, I went to the library with Horikita in tow. It was
where we’d be having our discussion with Class 1-D, who Nanase
would be bringing with her today. On our way there, we chatted
about the special exam.
“Have you checked out today’s update yet?” I asked her.
“Seventeen more partnerships have been finalized. Which
brings the total number of partnerships to seventy-three,” replied
Horikita.
While there wasn’t anything about the number of
partnerships itself that was particularly noteworthy, there was one
substantial difference between this last update and the previous
two. Namely, the fact that two students from Class 1-D had
decided upon partners. There were now some visible signs of
activity in a class which had, for the past three days, seemed
motionless.
“I’m a little flustered. I thought Housen-kun was planning to
wait and see how things would play out a little longer. I tried
talking to some Class 1-D students today during lunch, but they
just brushed me off, saying they didn’t really know anything about
the students who decided on partners,” said Horikita.
“It’s hard to tell if they really don’t know, or if they’re just
under some kind of gag order.”
It wouldn’t be too surprising if there was some kind of rule in
place, forbidding them from partnering with anyone or even talking
about the whole situation unless one of the smart kids in class got
offered a lot of points.
“That’s true. At any rate, it’s great that we’ll be meeting with
Nanase-san now. I’m sure she might be able to tell us something
about this situation,” said Horikita.
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_192">
<p>Horikita had only ever met Nanase once, and they’d never
actually ever had a proper conversation. Even so, Nanase, the
person who’d stood beside Housen, seemed to be someone with
whom we could communicate. Personally, I’d gotten a strong
impression that she was an honest person when we talked. She
had a very firm, upright character, vaguely reminiscent of Ichinose
somehow.
Horikita and I arrived at the library. When we set foot inside,
the first person to greet us wasn’t Nanase, but rather Shiina Hiyori,
from Class 2-C.
“Oh, hello there, fancy seeing you here,” said Hiyori.
Apparently, this bookworm had come to the library right
away after class today.
“We might be making a little noise today. We’re going to talk
to some first-year students about the special exam,” I told her.
“Oh, is that so? In that case, it might be a good idea for you
to use the seats in the far back. I don’t think you’ll bother the
other patrons then, and you should be able to talk a little. Also,
you’ll quickly notice if someone does try to approach you,” said
Hiyori.
I decided to take the advice she had so kindly given me.
“Are things coming along okay in Class C?” I asked.
“Yes, they are. It seems there’s a lot going on right now.”
Since our classes were competing with one another, we
couldn’t exactly clue each other in on their inner workings. So with
that brief exchange of pleasantries, we said goodbye to Hiyori and
decided to go take our seats. While I was still kind of curious about
what was going on with Hiyori, I went with Horikita toward the
seats at the back of the room.
“Putting Nanase-san aside, now that we’re getting involved
with Class 1-D, it raises the question of whether Housen-kun is
going to show up,” said Horikita.
“Yeah. I guess that whether he shows up or not is going to
make a substantial difference to how this goes.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_193">
<p>Since we hadn’t given Nanase restrictions, there was no
guarantee she wouldn’t bring Housen with her. If she did bring him
along, we’d just have to go for broke and negotiate for all we were
worth, flying by the seat of our pants.
“I hope you don’t mind if I ask you something before we
start a full-blown discussion. Have you been studying?” asked
Horikita.
“Well, a little bit, here and there. Why, what about it?” I
asked.
“I was just wondering whether you’re getting enough time
for your studies, considering I have an advantage in this situation
by being able to choose the subject.”
“Oh, what’s this? Taking pity on your enemy?” I teased.
“As if. I’m not so nice as to willingly give up advantageous
conditions. This is a contest I must win,” said Horikita.
Even so, she was apparently concerned about whether I was
studying properly or not. Which was to say, she was actually
worried that I’d come up with some excuse that I was too busy
dealing with the special exam to study, or something like that.
“You’re one to talk, you know. You’re spending a lot of your
time getting our class organized,” I replied.
“I always make sure to devote time to my studies. I have no
problems whatsoever,” said Horikita.
She seemed to be quite confident that she had managed her
time well, with everything she had to do in her daily routine.
“Well, relax. I don’t plan on losing,” I told her.
“Well, that’s all well and good, I suppose…”
She didn’t seem to trust me, strangely enough. She didn’t
seem to think that I was taking this test seriously.
To that point, there was one other thing that I wanted to ask
her about. Horikita had a lot of roles to fill, in addition to keeping
our class organized. She had to spend time on her own studies
and on top of that, she tutored others. I had no idea if she could
keep going at that pace all the way up until test day.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_194">
<p>Just as I was about to ask Horikita about that though,
Nanase showed up at the library, alone. She quickly located us,
rushed over toward us, and bowed her head. From the looks of
things, Housen wasn’t going to be showing up to this initial
discussion.
“Sorry to have kept you waiting,” said Nanase, politely.
“Nah, we just got here ourselves,” I replied.
Horikita prompted Nanase to sit down in the seat directly
across from her and opened the discussion with a brief
introductory greeting.
“All right, well… Once again, my name’s Horikita Suzune.
Thank you for making the time to talk with us today,” said Horikita.
“Yeah, and I’m… Err, I mean yes, I am Nanase Tsubasa. I
haven’t done anything worthy of your thanks, though. If anything,
I should be the one thanking you,” replied Nanase.
We were all in Class D, so we all started from an
exceptionally humble position. Horikita, after listening to Nanase’s
polite and proper words, decided to immediately get down to
business. “I’m sorry for how sudden this might be, but do you
mind if I ask you some questions?”
“Not at all, please go ahead,” said Nanase.
“First, just to establish a baseline, I’d like to ask what your
class’s policies are. Two students in your class confirmed
partnerships today, while the status of the remaining thirty-eight
students in your class remains to be seen. You were one of the
two students who confirmed a partnership, aren’t you, Nanase-
san?” asked Horikita.
While it wasn’t clear if it was Housen or someone else, it was
clear a member of their class was giving orders here.
“That’s correct. I had a feeling you’d ask me about that. I’m
assuming you asked Kajiwara-kun that same question today, yes?”
replied Nanase.
Kajiwara was the name of another student in Nanase’s class.
Apparently, she already knew that Horikita had reached out to
Class 1-D students during lunch today. If that was the case, I</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_195">
<p>supposed we ought to assume she also knew that we had reached
out to Shiratori and his friends on the first day of the exam period.
“I’m surprised. You seem to have a very good handle on this
situation,” said Horikita.
“Many students are already acting on Housen-kun’s orders,”
said Nanase matter-of-factly, openly admitting that Housen was
the one taking the lead, rather than being evasive about it.
“Is it because of his aggressive attitude? No, I can’t imagine
that’s all there is to it. What methods did he use, exactly?” asked
Horikita.
Nanase looked like she was lost in thought for a brief
moment. Then she opened her mouth to speak.
“I am terribly sorry, but unfortunately, I can’t tell you exactly
what kind of methods he used. Housen-kun brought the class
together. Whether the way he did that was right or wrong, I do not
know. But letting word of it get outside our class would be an act
of betrayal,” said Nanase.
“I see. You’re correct in saying so,” said Horikita.
In response to that, Nanase thanked Horikita again and
bowed. I supposed that just because we were Nanase’s seniors,
that didn’t necessarily mean she was going to tell us anything. Just
like in our conversation the other day, she seemed to have firm
thoughts and convictions as a member of her class.
“In that case, I’ll get right to the point. Is it safe for us to
assume we will be able to work with your class, just like those two
students who settled on their partnerships yesterday?” asked
Horikita.
“As I’m sure you’ve already heard from Shiratori-kun, our
offer is always open. As long as you offer us a set number of
Private Points with your proposal, we will accept whatever
partnership requests you make, without hesitation,” said Nanase.
So our chat with Shiratori and his friends had reached
Housen after all. From that, we could infer a high number of points
were paid out to the two students from their class who had gotten
partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_196">
<p>“But what I’m asking you about today is different from
establishing a partnership contract based on points,” replied
Horikita.
“Yes, I know. I’ve already heard a little about your offer from
Ayanokouji-senpai. A collaborative relationship where we would
cover for each other—that is to say, mutually work to protect the
less academically inclined students in our classes, yes?”
“Yes. If you’ve come to this discussion understanding all that,
there must be some room for negotiation, yes?”
“There is… Or at least, I’d like to think so.”
Nanase’s face darkened. Then she continued speaking.
“Housen-kun’s way of thinking is rooted in ideas of intense
individualism. And he enforces that ideology. If things continue at
this rate, the less academically capable students will be unable to
find partners, and get left behind. If they only got their Private
Points withheld for three months, that wouldn’t be too bad. But I
fear they’ll end up being branded as incompetent for their failure
to find partners. Well, no… I suppose that might not be too bad,
either. What I really don’t want to happen is for this intense sense
of individualism to dominate our class in the future, to the point
where we lose any sense of unity,” said Nanase.
Horikita listened to everything Nanase had to say, and then
mentally calculated what might happen to Class 1-D in the future.
“Right, that is a valid concern,” she said. “If no one in the
class helps each other out, the trend toward individualism will
naturally accelerate. Once there’s no one around to assist other
students, everyone will feel like they must do things on their own.
Once that ideology has sunk in, even if someone does ask for help,
no one will step in. Which means that if your class were faced with
a test that required you to function as one, you’d lose that battle.”
Which was precisely why Nanase took it upon herself to
negotiate with Horikita alone. She was trying to avoid that fate.
“You’re not afraid of Housen-kun?” asked Horikita.
“No,” replied Nanase, firmly, without a second’s delay.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_197">
<p>She hadn’t glanced much at me until this point, but now
looked over in my direction. It was the same look she’d given me
twice before. I remembered that when I asked her something
similar, she responded with “I will never yield to violence.”
There were things about her that bothered me, of course,
but Nanase might be the only person who could get her class on
our side. If this really was nothing more than a chance encounter,
I was honestly grateful for it.
“Well then, I’d like to ask you a slightly more in-depth
question. How many students in your class are currently struggling
to find partners? Please tell us about as many as you can,
regardless of academic ability,” said Horikita.
The OAA app could tell you which students had yet to finalize
partnerships, but not how likely they were to find a partner or not.
To learn that, you could only ask someone directly related to that
class.
“At this current point in time, I think that there are close to
fifteen students who would have difficulty in finding a partner on
their own,” said Nanase.
“Fifteen… That’s more than I thought,” said Horikita.
However, many students in our class hadn’t found partners,
either. If we came up with good combinations of people, there was
still room for our classes to work well together.
“Nanase-san. If you’ll allow it, we would like to come to a
rather significant arrangement with your class,” said Horikita.
“A significant arrangement?” she repeated.
“I’m hoping you and I can come up with fifteen partnership
pairings and take care of this matter all at once, Nanase-san. It
doesn’t matter if they have an E or an A in academic ability. There
are no conditions. And of course, no points will be involved. An
equal partnership based on mutual collaboration, where we both
strive to help those who need it,” said Horikita.
In other words, give-and-take. The idea was that we would
mutually give and take what we needed, without getting points or</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_198">
<p>feelings involved. Establishing such an agreement would likely
greatly reduce the probability of students getting expelled.
But both Horikita and Nanase knew that it wasn’t going to be
that simple.
“This is all based on the assumption that we can come to an
agreement. But there’s no guarantee that we can save the
students in your class who are near E-rank in academic ability,
Horikita-senpai. Most of the students in our class who are
struggling to find partners are around C and D level,” said Nanase.
Even if the highest-ranked student they had available had a
C+, they’d still be at significant risk if they were paired with an E-
ranked student from our class. You might say the benefits of such
an arrangement were almost nil.
“In that case, I’m going to need to ask you to do your
absolute best to make sure things don’t turn out that way for us,”
said Horikita.
“Yes, I suppose you’re right. Even so, I don’t think we’ll be
able to come to terms that easily,” said Nanase, not denying that
there could be issues, but openly admitting to it. “Housen-kun
would never approve of helping you for free. Especially not now.”
Class 1-A had held onto a great many points ever since they
started school last year, and they had ample funds saved. Even
though Class C had blown through a considerable number of points
in order to save Ryuuen, they still had a stable supply of funds
thanks to their contract with Class A. I was sure Ryuuen’s
classmates probably had a fair number of points saved up, too.
Considering the current situation, where 2-C and 2-A were
throwing around lots of points in a bidding war, it was not at all
surprising that the new students would want to sell themselves to
the highest bidder.
So you could say that Housen’s way of thinking was correct.
But even if he tried to put a high price tag on the kids from his
class, the truth of the matter was that they were asking for more
than the other classes. The small number of students from his
class who had settled on partners spoke to this.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_199">
<p>“Even if it would be for the good of his class?” asked
Horikita. “There should be no downsides to this for him.”
It would be more of a downside if some students were
unable to find partners and thus deprived of Private Points they
were supposed to have raked in. Though I was sure that went
without saying.
“I know what you’re trying to say, Horikita-senpai.
I understand much of what you’re saying very well,” said Nanase.
She seemed to be responding quite positively to Horikita’s
proposal. However…
“But… I don’t think Housen-kun will allow it, after all.”
There was a slight pause. I had a general idea of what she
was thinking about. So I took a guess.
“Well, there’s one thing we can be sure of. Housen isn’t
taking the points for himself,” I replied.
“What do you mean?” asked Horikita.
“I thought the reason Housen was only allowing partnerships
to form if people paid a high number of points was because he
was taking the points for himself. However, if that were really the
case, then he’d be more proactive about trying to set up even the
lower-ranked students. And in extreme cases, he’d be telling those
students to hand over what points they have so he could go find a
partner for them.” I replied.
“Yes, you’re certainly right… Three months’ worth of Private
Points is nothing to scoff at. It would be much better to pay
Housen-kun half your points and be saved, rather than get a failing
grade and not get any points at all for all that time,” said Horikita.
There was nothing to suggest that Housen was doing
anything of the sort, though. Not in what we’d seen their class do
so far, nor in our conversation with Nanase.
“Ayanokouji-senpai’s deduction is correct. Housen-kun has
not received any kind of compensation from our classmates,” said
Nanase.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_200">
<p>He was controlling his class and imposing rules upon them.
Presumably, if a student broke those rules, they would be
completely ostracized by Housen and his followers. Which was why
they didn’t dare try and find a partner without permission. They
couldn’t. And the reason why no one from their class showed up to
the meet-and-greet was because they knew it would be pointless.
“Couldn’t you use your influence to control even a few of the
more academically gifted students?” asked Horikita.
There was no form of quid pro quo of any kind in Horikita’s
proposal. She was only asking for students from both of our
classes to help one another. Unlike the students in our grade level,
though, the new students naturally had less emotional attachment
to their class and to their friends. It was unreasonable to expect
them to have formed strong emotional connections only a couple
of weeks after enrollment.
“I tried talking to a few of them, but none of them said
they’d even consider it,” replied Nanase.
“It sounds like some form of quid pro quo is a requirement
after all, then,” said Horikita.
“If we only need a couple people, couldn’t we work out an
arrangement using points?” I asked, turning to Horikita.
If our goal was to fight with our wallets, like Class A and
Class C, we’d need a huge amount of funds in order to recruit a
significant number of students. But if we focused only on getting a
few students, just enough to stop anyone from being expelled, our
costs would be reduced accordingly.
“That’s true… I suppose that if we really run out of options,
we’ll have no choice but to go that route. But relationships created
using Private Points can only be maintained using Private Points. I
want a relationship that goes beyond that,” said Horikita,
responding to me.
She then turned to look right at Nanase.
“What do you mean by that?” asked Nanase.
“Our grade levels are on different playing fields. First-year
students have no risk of being expelled, so you’re in a better</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_201">
<p>position than us. However, that dynamic won’t last forever. The
day will come when you have to do battle while facing possible
expulsion, not too far from now. If you only establish relationships
based on points, what do you think will happen when the time
comes that you need to pay up and are out of funds?” asked
Horikita.
Some students might still make it through, but it wouldn’t be
surprising if many of them did not.
“Which is precisely why I’d like to establish an equal
partnership, not a dynamic based on points. And I want to build
trust. The special kind of trust that comes from us being from
different grade levels,” added Horikita.
She was essentially saying that by doing things this way,
establishing this kind of partnership, we would be able to discuss
things as equals when students from Nanase’s class had problems
in the future. In short, a strategy that valued trust, just like what
Ichinose was doing. The main difference between us and Ichinose,
though, was that we were partnering exclusively with Class 1-D,
while she was helping students from every class. Instead of trying
to appeal to everyone, Horikita had zeroed in on Class 1-D,
wanting to establish a collaboration with them.
We were already on the fourth day of the special exam
period. We couldn’t afford to waste any more time.
Nanase must have understood how driven Horikita was. Even
so, her darkened expression didn’t light up.
“I understand very well what you’re trying to say. But I don’t
think that my peers understand the same. Many of the first-years
are already frantically working to save up Private Points. They
would see partnering with someone for free as a loss, simple as
that,” said Nanase.
The only way they’d understand would be with time, as they
came to know the system this school operated on.
“Right now, there are two major obstacles in the way of us
partnering up with your class, based on what you’re telling us. We
need to convince Housen-kun, and we need to persuade the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_202">
<p>honors students who want points. Well, I suppose the latter point
could really apply to students from any class, not just yours, but…”
It was certainly true that, at least on the surface, the many
obstacles in our path made it seem like it wasn’t particularly
beneficial to team up with their class. One of those obstacles, in
particular—dealing with Housen.
But that wasn’t actually true. I wondered if Horikita was
aware of this fact.
“Please allow me to discuss things with Housen-kun,”
proposed Horikita, having decided that it would be impossible for
us to proceed any further without Housen.
“Yes, I suppose that’s reasonable… If we’re going to try to
establish an equal partnership, there’s no avoiding the fact we’ll
need to talk to him,” said Nanase.
“If it’s all right with you, I’m ready to meet with him
immediately,” said Horikita.
“I understand. I’ll try calling him,” replied Nanase.
She took out her phone and headed toward the library exit.
“It seems like Housen-kun’s control extends even further
than I had imagined,” said Horikita.
“Seems like it,” I replied.
“My idea about teaming up with Class 1-D isn’t…wrong, is
it?” asked Horikita.
“Looking to the future and trying to build a relationship with
them isn’t a bad strategy,” I told her. “If anything, I’d say it’s a
prerequisite for what we need to do. Sakayanagi and Ryuuen are
trying to buy the trust of skilled first-years by using their class’s
reputation or using points. Ichinose lacks for points, but she’s also
working to build trust by saving those in need of help. You’re doing
something similar to Ichinose, but you’re focused on building a
relationship with just one specific class. Right? It’s the same thing,
but with different methods and in a different form. You’re already
becoming a leader who can compete with those three.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_203">
<p>Horikita nodded after hearing what I had to say. Now, we
just had to see how well she could handle negotiations.
As we waited, I saw Nanase beckoning us over towards the
exit, bowing to us.
“I wonder if something happened,” said Horikita.
“Let’s go and find out.”
We left the library and joined up with Nanase.
“Please excuse me, senpai. Um, well… Housen-kun is on the
line,” said Nanase.
She handed her phone over to Horikita. It was currently set
on mute. Horikita took it from her and then put it on speakerphone
before beginning her conversation with Housen.
“Sorry to have kept you waiting,” said Horikita.
“Sup. I heard a li’l bit from Nanase.”
“If possible, I’d like for us to meet in person so I can explain
my proposal to you directly,” said Horikita.
“Ain’t no need. Don’t gotta bother meetin’ up,” replied
Housen, with a laugh.
“So, does that… mean that you’re not willing to negotiate?”
“Exactly what it means. Wasn’t even any point in talkin’ to ya
on the phone, but Nanase wasn’t havin’ any of it.”
“Housen-kun, I think that it would be a good idea to consider
her offer,” said Nanase.
“Shut the hell up. What right do you got to talk to me like
that, huh? HUH? I’ll kill you.”
“I have no intention of letting you kill me. Please meet with
Horikita-senpai at least once,” said Nanase.
“If you can’t cough up enough points, then don’t bother
contactin’ me again.”
Nanase tried to continue the conversation, but Housen
quickly ended the call. She immediately called him back, but no
matter how many times she dialed his number, he didn’t answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_204">
<p>“…I’m so sorry!” shouted Nanase, apologizing to Horikita and
me while bowing her head as low as she possibly could.
It wasn’t like she’d done anything wrong, though.
“Come on, lift your head. My plans and Housen-kun’s are
completely different. It was clear things weren’t going to work out
that easily. I’m incredibly grateful that you went out of your way to
assist us so much,” said Horikita.
“It really wasn’t much…” replied Nanase, bashfully.
“I think that’s all for today. Now, we need to think of a way
to get Housen-kun to talk to us. But I’d like to try and get this over
with by the end of this week,” said Horikita.
If this got drawn out any longer, she’d have to start looking
beyond just Class 1-D. Nevertheless, I hoped that it wouldn’t come
to that. It would be quite a painstaking task for us to try and
snatch up students from the other three classes, when they’ve
already been thoroughly picked over.
“I’m awfully glad to hear that you still haven’t given up,
Horikita-senpai. But…” Nanase trailed off, swallowing the words
that were about to come out of her mouth. She was probably
going to tell us we’d never be able to form a real partnership with
Housen, but had decided it would be all over if she actually came
out and said that.
“At the very least, we conveyed to Housen-kun what I want
to do. That’s enough for now.”
Even though Horikita was running out of both time and
patience, she still spoke encouragingly to her junior. Horikita then
suggested we all walk back to the dorms together, but Nanase
apparently had somewhere else to be, so she left, after telling us
that she’d like to meet us again in the library tomorrow. Maybe she
went to go meet up with Housen.
“Let’s head back. I’ve still got a full schedule ahead of me
today,” said Horikita.
From the sounds of it, she was going to hold a study session
with Sudou and some other people after she got back to her room.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_205">
<p>“Oh, and I think I’d like to hear more about your partner
situation now, if possible. Like if you’re going to be finding a
partner on your own or if you’re planning to let me handle it for
you. It might have an impact on things down the line,” said
Horikita.
If we were going to start negotiations with Housen, I was
sure we’d probably need to adjust the specific number of people
involved.
“There’s someone I think I might be able to work with,” I
replied.
“Does that mean you actually have a specific person in mind,
rather than looking at academic ability rankings? Who?” asked
Horikita.
“That’s a secret,” I answered.
“A secret…? What do you have to hide from me?”
“I’ve only just scratched the surface of what this person is
like, I don’t know anything beyond that about them yet.”
“Is that really that much of a problem? We all have to fumble
around and do our best to help each other, right?” said Horikita.
“Yeah, I guess so. I thought it would become clearer to me
today, but… Well, I guess I’ll know by the end of the week, at the
latest.”
“I suppose that’s all well and good, but…I don’t know how
much I can help you even if you come crying to me at the last
minute, you know.”
“I’ll keep that in mind. Oh, more importantly, I forgot to ask
you earlier. Are you feeling okay?” I asked her.
“…Are you worried about me?”
“I probably don’t need to worry about your energy levels
right now, but there are still quite a few days to go before the
special exam,” I told her.
If she got dizzy and worn out in the final stretch, it could
affect how things went on the day of the test. In addition to her
daily study sessions, she’d also spent a fair amount of time</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_206">
<p>preparing for Amasawa’s cooking challenge late Tuesday night. It
was obvious that fatigue was gradually accumulating.
“It’s true that I might get worn out in the final stretch. But I
don’t have the time to rest right now. I’m not planning on
collapsing until after the special exam is over,” said Horikita.
Rather than just trying to look tough, she was beginning to
show the mentality of someone who knew they were leading their
class into battle. Yousuke and Kushida were already helping. They
needed no introduction. But even other students with a high level
of academic prowess, like Keisei and Mii-chan, had offered to help
Horikita right away this time. So she decided to push ahead with
her plan, which was based on the premise of working with Class 1-
D now and into the future.
If a leader acted without thinking, or delayed making a
decision, it could only have a negative impact on the ones they
led. In this race against time, the speed at which we could settle
things was critical to our class.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_207">
<p>6.1
 
IT WAS A LITTLE CHILLY that night. I stood in the kitchen,
cooking something with the vast quantities of untouched groceries
I had been forced to buy the other day. This time, of course, I was
using recipes and videos as a guide while I cooked. I wanted to try
the tom yum goong I’d made for Amasawa for myself. The name
of the dish, tom yum goong, was a combination of three Thai
words, which meant “to simmer,” “to mix,” and “shrimp.”
“It’s got a unique flavor, but it’s not bad,” I said aloud.
The way the spicy and sour flavors filled my mouth, and the
way the aroma shot up my nose, definitely made it seem like a
dish that would be a hit with people who were into these flavors
and sensations. After I was done cleaning up, I turned on the
ventilation fan to get rid of the smell that had filled the room. Even
though the sound was drowned by the noise from the fan, I
eventually noticed my phone vibrating on my bed. I thought I’d
just let it go and I’d call back later, but it just never stopped
ringing, so I picked it up.
“You sure took your time answering the phone,” said the
person on the other line.
It was Kei. This was the first time I had gotten a call from
her in several days, since the special exam started. And the first
thing that came out of her mouth was a complaint.
“Aren’t you the one who told me to call you around this time?
Get your act together,” added Kei.
“Sorry. So, did you look into the thing I had asked you to this
morning?”
“I’m only calling you because I did a great job of it. Don’t
you think you’re not being nearly grateful enough to me?”
“I am grateful. So?”
“I don’t really feel like you’re grateful at all, but… Well,
whatever. Anyway, according to the clerk, only one’s been sold
since April this year. It seems it barely sells at all, compared to</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_208">
<p>similar things, and they’re lucky if they sell or one two a year. Oh,
but get this, there was some new kid who tried to buy one,” said
Kei.
I already knew exactly who the person who’d bought one
was. So I was more interested in hearing about the new student
who tried to buy one.
“When you say they ‘tried’ to buy it, that means that they
didn’t actually buy it in the end, right?”
There was no way someone would be functionally incapable
of buying that product, unless they did something absurd like
spend all of their points right after starting school here. And if you
were in the batch of new students that had arrived this particular
year, I couldn’t imagine you would do something so foolish.
“So, anyway, yeah, I tried asking the clerk about it.
Apparently, right as the kid was trying to check out, someone else
came up and said they shouldn’t buy it, that they should put it
back. And the student who tried to buy it was—”
As I listened to Kei give me details about this student, I
analyzed the situation in my mind. It was a little… actually, no, it
was quite a bit different from what I had originally envisioned. I’d
never expected that they would be involved in this.
“Do we know who prompted the student to not buy the
item?” I asked.
“Nope. The clerk didn’t know who it was. They just said they
were pretty sure that it was a girl, though,” said Kei.
Students presented their I.D. when making purchases, so the
clerk would’ve known the name of the one who tried to buy the
item. But they wouldn’t have known who stepped in and stopped
them.
“Was my info useful?” said Kei.
“Yeah. Actually way more useful than I originally thought it’d
be.”
“Heh heh. Well, I am pretty capable, after all. You need to
really show me some gratitude for this. But why’d you have me</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_209">
<p>look into something like this, anyway? I honestly don’t get it at all,”
said Kei.
“Neither do I.”
“Huh?”
I had thought having Kei look into this would give me
something to help make sense of this person’s incomprehensible
behavior, but this development went far beyond what I had
imagined. In fact, it was so disconnected from what I had
imagined that it made me wonder if it was actually completely
irrelevant.
“Oh, that reminds me, I heard that you got yourself a
partner for the special exam,” I told her.
“Oh, yeah. Shimazaki-san from Class 1-B, I think his name
was. I feel like Kushida-san really came through and saved the day
for me,” said Kei.
Now that we’d dealt with the item of business, I figured I’d
change the topic.
“I don’t think your partner’s too bad or anything, but are you
making pretty good progress on your studies yourself, Kei?” I
asked.
“Oh, well, uh, how do I put this…? I guess I was thinking I
could start doing it at the last minute, maybe?”
I knew it. I hadn’t heard anything about her going to the
study group yet, so I figured as much.
“This exam isn’t something you can get through completely
on your own, you know. Kei, your grade is a D+. If you don’t
consider the fact that you’re not really in the best position here,
you could be in for a world of hurt,” I told her.
“I know, I know that. It’s just, I dunno, I just don’t feel
motivated to do anything… And if I do go to study group, you
won’t be there, Kiyotaka,” said Kei.
“What? So, you’re saying that you’ll study hard if I’m there?”
I asked.
“…Yeah, so? I’d work hard in front of my boyfriend,” said Kei.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_210">
<p>I wasn’t sure if that was true or not, but if that’s the way it
was, there was a quick and easy solution.
“In that case, how about we… Yeah. How about you come to
my room around six o’clock tomorrow?” I asked.
Considering the fact that we had a meeting with Nanase
after class, that should be plenty of time.
“I can come hang out with you?!” she exclaimed.
“We’re not going to hang out, we’re going to study,” I
replied.
“Huh?”
Don’t you “huh” me.
“I’ll help you study. That should help you get a little
motivated, right?” I replied.
First of all, I’d try to get a concrete sense of where Kei’s
actual abilities were at. Then, if I found she was at a level where
additional study sessions were essential, I’d have to strongly
encourage her to go.
“You’re worried ’cause you’d be sad if your girlfriend got
expelled, aren’t you?” said Kei rather suddenly and happily, almost
like she thought she had the upper hand on me.
I could have answered her in a somewhat mean or teasing
way, but Kei would probably be more motivated if I told her I was
worried.
“Of course I’m worried. If the girl I just started going out
with got expelled, that wouldn’t make me happy,” I told her.
“I-I see… I mean, I know, right?! Well, in that case, I guess I
don’t have any choice now, do I? I actually did have tons of things
planned, but I’ll make a special appearance, just for you,” said Kei.
While it wasn’t exactly the most honest answer I could’ve
given her, it was a small price to get her to make progress.
“What should I bring with me?” she asked.
“Everything you’ll need is already here in my room. As long
as you aren’t late, there’s nothing else we’ll need,” I told her.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_211">
<p>“Okay,” said Kei.
“All right, I’m hanging up now.”
“W-Wait, hold on! Wait! We only talked about the special
exam and studying and stuff though!” wailed Kei.
Apparently, she wanted to talk about something unrelated to
those matters.
“Yeah, I suppose you’ve got a point.”
“Jeez, you really are a piece of work,” said Kei.
For a while after that, we no longer talked about the exam or
about studying. Instead, she continued to shower me with
criticism.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_212">
<p>6.2
 
ON FRIDAY, the fifth day of the exam period, eighty-one
partnerships had been confirmed. Which meant that a little more
than half of all students had found partners, including more and
more students from within Class 2-D.
The same held true for those close to me. Yesterday, Kei had
gotten herself a partner. And now Airi and Haruka from the
Ayanokouji Group had both confirmed their partnerships, too.
The driving force behind those partnerships was Kushida.
She worked with her kouhai from junior high school, Yagami, to
introduce some of the students in our class to kids from Class 1-B.
That was a big deal. However, it didn’t solve all our problems.
Although Yagami was rising to prominence within his class, he
seemed to have no intention of taking on a leadership role, and
was only cooperating with Kushida as an individual, at most. It
wasn’t like he could provide us with enough students to cover
everyone in our class who was struggling.
Yagami had only one condition for his cooperation. Namely,
that he had to be Kushida’s partner. That had apparently come to
pass yesterday, as reflected in the OAA update. Having Kushida
partner with Yagami basically used up one of our more
academically gifted students, but Horikita didn’t seem dissatisfied
by the exchange, considering the level of support we’d gotten out
of it.
There were still quite a few capable people left in our class,
including Horikita herself, Yousuke, Keisei, Mii-chan, Matsushita,
and others. In any case, just because a student had chosen a
partner didn’t mean they could rest easy. You had to study hard.
That was completely unavoidable. If anything, it could be said the
competition only really got started once you found a partner.
Even though I wasn’t speaking to anyone all that much, I
could sense a feeling of unity in our class, with people working
together. This was possible precisely because we were friends who</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_213">
<p>had been through thick and thin together for a year. And in the
midst of all of that…
One of the students stood up and tried to leave.
Then Horikita, as if she were waiting for the right moment, walked
over and called to him.
“It seems like you still haven’t found a partner yet, Kouenji-
kun.”
“And what of it?” replied Kouenji.
This was an act of intervention on Horikita’s part, with the
single, solitary person who wasn’t contributing to our class’s
togetherness.
“I just thought I’d talk to you and see how your situation is
going, as your classmate. So, how are things?” asked Horikita.
You generally knew what even the students who worked
independently were up to, because they would talk to the people
around them. But since Kouenji didn’t say anything at all, we
couldn’t tell what was going on with him.
“You’re smart. You’ve never even considered the possibility
that you might get expelled, have you?” said Horikita.
“Of course not.”
“I suppose not, no. Even if you were partnered with a
student with grades like Ike-kun’s, you would still score close to
four-hundred points quite easily. I think you’d be safe,” said
Horikita.
Generally speaking, you’d think we might want to position
Kouenji as one of our most valuable assets, since he was a smart
student. I supposed that was the purpose behind Horikita reaching
out to him like this, but still…
“Fu fu fu. What I’m saying is that I am not going to do
anything in this special exam. The important thing is that whoever
my partner will be gets a score of one hundred and fifty points or
higher on the test. As long as that minimum-level requirement is
satisfied, it will be quite easy for me to get a high enough score to
pass, you see,” replied Kouenji.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_214">
<p>According to what Chabashira told us, everyone should be
able to at least get one hundred and fifty points on this test. So,
unless you teamed up with an assassin from the White Room, it
was unlikely you’d have to worry about your partner getting a zero
on the test, like I did.
However, you still had to rely on your partner. And no matter
how hard you looked, you probably wouldn’t find a student who
could state with absolute, one-hundred-percent certainty that they
would score a certain amount on the test. Students from both
grade levels had to work on the assumption that their partners
would score at least one hundred and fifty points. It was a ninety-
nine-point-nine-percent certainty at best.
In order to make that as close to one hundred percent as
possible, the school had implemented a rule stating that students
who scored low enough that it appeared to deviate from their
expected level of academic ability would be expelled. Because of
that fact, Kouenji could afford to be confident. Which meant there
was no need for him to go through the trouble of trying to talk to
anyone or to build a relationship.
“You mean you’re fine no matter who you get partnered
with? In that case, why don’t you allow me to decide your partner
for you? I understand you think you’ll be safe regardless of who
you’re with, but I imagine you’d rather not get hit with a five
percent penalty,” said Horikita.
It was a rather simple offer. She was offering to handle
everything for him. A proposal which could fundamentally only be
beneficial to him.
“Yes, certainly, it is as you say. However, I must decline your
offer,” said Kouenji.
“…Why? Can I ask you to tell me the reason for that?” said
Horikita.
“Because I am who I am.”
Simply put, he didn’t like the idea of being used for Horikita’s
convenience. No matter the situation, Kouenji was Kouenji. If I
was ever in a situation where I needed to use Kouenji in order to</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_215">
<p>win, I would find myself thinking I should’ve gone with a different
strategy to avoid being put in such a situation in the first place.
“Satisfied?” asked Kouenji.
After hearing what Kouenji had to say back to her, Horikita
couldn’t keep pushing. Kouenji wasn’t the kind of person who
would budge at all, even if you tried to force him. It was a waste
of effort.
“Yes, for now. But you can’t carry on like this forever, you
know. When the class needs to come together, we will need your
cooperation,” said Horikita.
She wasn’t talking about this particular special exam. Horikita
was looking ahead to what might come in the future. It seemed
she wanted to say something now for him to keep in mind.
“Well, I can understand why you’d want to rely on someone
as perfect as I, but I don’t think I can offer you any advice,” said
Kouenji.
And then he left, as if he couldn’t be bothered to listen
anymore, headed off to who knew where, like usual.
“Kouenji sure is impossible, huh,” I said aloud to Horikita,
jumping in and adding my two cents almost without even thinking
about it.
“I’m just irritated by the fact that if he took things seriously,
our class would be that much stronger,” said Horikita.
There was hardly anything as frustrating as having a secret
weapon that you couldn’t use. It was precisely because she had
those feelings of expectation that she felt despair when things
ended unsuccessfully.
“If I were in your shoes, I wouldn’t have counted on him to
start with,” I told her.
It would probably be easier to think of Kouenji as a special
case from now, and just leave it at that.
“I’m not giving up,” said Horikita.
“…I see.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_216">
<p>I was afraid she’d only end up wasting her time and going in
circles, but I supposed it was a good thing that she was motivated.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_217">
<p>6.3
 
AS SOON AS I set foot in the library that weekend, I could
sense the atmosphere was different from the other day. Many
students, both first- and second-years, had gathered there. Most of
the students had their tablets and notebooks spread out in front of
them and were engaged in what looked like a study session. It
seemed a lot of students were starting to move forward and take
steps they needed to take, rather than let themselves get
complacent after having found a partner. I vaguely recalled that we
had a study session here in the library too, about a year ago.
“This is a bit of a bother. With this many people around, we
might end up attracting unnecessary attention,” said Horikita.
“In that case, it’d probably be a good idea for us to try to
blend in.”
Fortunately for us, the seats we had used at the back of the
library yesterday were still available. Since it wouldn’t have been
surprising if they’d been taken, I fixed my gaze on a certain part of
the room. Shortly afterward, I saw Hiyori, waving to me with a
gentle smile on her face.
“I thought that you might be coming today, Ayanokouji-kun,
so I made a special request that those seats be reserved for you,”
said Hiyori.
“Was that okay?” I asked.
“Well, I suppose it would’ve been a different story if the
library were full to capacity, but there’s no need to worry,” said
Hiyori.
This was a spacious library, so there was quite a bit of room.
That being said, it was still a kind gesture on her part to do that
for us.
“Please, go ahead and take all the time you need,” said
Hiyori.
She must not have intended on staying for awfully long,
because Hiyori left immediately after saying that.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_218">
<p>“She really is quite kind, isn’t she? Do you think she heard
our conversation the other day?” asked Horikita.
“Hard to say. Considering how far away we were, I think it
would’ve been hard for her to eavesdrop.”
Since the seats had been generously reserved for us, we sat
in the same spot we did yesterday. Then we took study materials
from our bags, and acted as though we were there to study.
However, no matter how long we waited, there was no sign of
Nanase.
“Nanase-san is late,” said Horikita.
We had promised to meet after class, at four thirty in the
afternoon. But it was already past five now. We had sent her
multiple messages, but there was no sign she’d read any of them.
It might be a good idea for us to go and check on her right about
now, but that was tricky, since we didn’t know where she was.
“Should we go looking around the first-year classrooms for
the time being…?” asked Horikita.
Just as we were about to go and do that, though, Nanase
appeared, looking rather flustered. Once she noticed us, she
approached, looking out of breath.
“I-I’m sorry. I kept you waiting for so long, and…!” huffed
Nanase.
“It’s all right. We were just worried that something might
have happened,” said Horikita.
“I was negotiating with Housen-kun, trying to see if I could
bring him along with me one way or another,” said Nanase.
“Is that so…? It seems like you were unsuccessful,
unfortunately.”
There wasn’t any sign that anyone else was coming through
the library doors.
“Still, he didn’t try to stop you from coming here to talk with
us today?” asked Horikita.
“He did not. Most likely because he doesn’t think that
anything could be decided without him,” said Nanase.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_219">
<p>No matter how much Nanase tried to do on her own, Housen
had the final say. I supposed if he had that kind of confidence,
there was no need for him to warn her or try to stop her every
time she did something.
“Seems like we have no choice but to try and force a
meeting with him after all,” said Horikita.
“But…”
“I realize we won’t be able to resolve matters so easily. But if
we don’t try and discuss things face-to-face, we’ll never reach any
kind of agreement,” said Horikita.
Today’s discussion certainly seemed like the kind of thing
that she wouldn’t want to rush into without thinking.
“Yes, you’re certainly right about that… but, well…” said
Nanase, trailing off.
She looked unsure of what she wanted to say, but then came
to a decision and started speaking once more.
“Horikita-senpai, you want to establish a collaborative
relationship with our class, at any cost. I’m not incorrect in saying
so, am I?” said Nanase.
“Not all. You’re absolutely correct.”
“In that case… Will you please listen to my proposal?”
Nanase seemed to have come up with some ideas of her
own, in her own way.
“It’s clear that even if you propose to Housen-kun that we
establish a fair and equal partnership, he will reject your offer flat-
out. I believe that would most likely be the case even if you met
with him in person, Horikita-senpai. In that case, how about
proceeding to negotiate with me, in secret?” said Nanase.
“Proceeding to negotiate with you, Nanase-san? But it’s not
like your classmates would go along with our plans without
Housen-kun’s involvement, would they?” said Horikita.
“You’re right. However, that’s only because I have yet to step
forward as leader,” said Nanase, coming right out with a rather
unexpected proposal. “I’ve decided we cannot continue going by</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_220">
<p>Housen-kun’s methods. Though these are desperate measures, I’m
hoping I can become the leader of my class before his dangerous
ideas spread too far. And to that end, I would like to establish a
relationship with your class, Horikita-senpai.”
Horikita had never expected Nanase to propose something
like this, of course. And neither had I, for that matter. Nanase
Tsubasa would become leader of Class 1-D, deposing Housen. If
that plan could be realized, Horikita’s goal of a collaborative
partnership would quickly become a reality.
“We don’t really have enough information to determine
whether you or Housen-kun would be a more appropriate choice
as leader, Nanase-san. However, one thing that I can tell you is
that we don’t have much time,” said Horikita.
The special exam period was already nearing its end. There
wasn’t enough time to fight over leadership.
“Many of my classmates don’t agree with Housen-kun’s way
of doing things. In fact, after talking things over with them—like
how we discussed things yesterday and today—I’ve successfully
managed to get seven students to agree to help,” said Nanase.
“And you’re sure it’s not just students with a low level of
academic ability?” asked Horikita.
“Yes. There are about three students with an academic ability
ranking of B- or better who are willing to negotiate,” said Nanase.
“…I see.”
Horikita thought for a moment. Three people certainly wasn’t
perfect, but if we could get just a few more, it might not be a bad
idea for us to try to go ahead and form this partnership, with
Nanase as the focal point.
“Won’t it spell trouble for us if Housen-kun finds out about
this?” asked Horikita.
“There would be quite a bit of trouble, needless to say, yes.
Which is why we’ll need to keep every part of this arrangement
secret all the way up to the day before the special exam, which is
the deadline for when partners need to be selected. If partner</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_221">
<p>applications are submitted at the last minute, he won’t notice
anything,” said Nanase.
“But that might make it difficult for us to win over the more
academically-inclined students from your class, won’t it?” asked
Horikita.
There was no changing the fact that those students would
want Private Points.
“We will help compensate you for that. The students in my
class who struggle academically will be saved thanks to you and
yours, Horikita-senpai, thereby avoiding the three-month penalty.
Therefore, we can float you some points. Even if you needed two
hundred thousand points to gain the cooperation of the more
academically gifted students from our class, we would still be able
to help you recoup. Although we wouldn’t be able to reach the
five-hundred-thousand-point per-person price that Housen-kun
would like, I think it would still be within an acceptable range,” said
Nanase.
So, they’d basically be sorting out this mess themselves,
then. We’d originally intended to use our own points to try to
entice the honors students from their class, but this way, the less
academically gifted students from their class would essentially be
using their own points to get their classmates to help out.
“This way, we won’t inconvenience you and your class,
Horikita-senpai. Of course, Housen-kun will surely be angry once
he finds out, but I intend to take full responsibility for everything
to ensure the kids who cooperated with me will not be harmed in
any way. What do you think?” asked Nanase.
“That’s… No matter how much you might say this would be
your responsibility as a leader, don’t you think that this proposal
places far too much on your shoulders?” said Horikita.
“It’s quite all right. I don’t want to lose this opportunity, and
I don’t want to lose your trust, Horikita-senpai, after you’ve offered
me a helping hand.” Nanase seemed to be saying this was a small
price to pay to save her classmates. “Besides, even if my class
doesn’t recognize me as its leader, I can at least save your class in
this special exam, Horikita-senpai.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_222">
<p>If you were to only consider the immediate benefits, then
Nanase’s proposal was by no means a bad one. I had to wonder
how Horikita would respond.
“Something is very clear to me now. Namely, that I want to
form a real partnership with your class,” said Horikita.
“In that case, are you saying that you agree with my
proposal?” asked Nanase.
“No. I’m afraid I cannot accept it.”
“But there’s no other way…”
“All your class’s problems will be resolved if we get Housen-
kun on our side. You don’t actually want to be the leader. You just
don’t like the way Housen-kun does things. Isn’t that so? In that
case, if Housen-kun is willing to do this without pay, there should
be plenty of other students who’ll support him, right?” said
Horikita.
“Well, yes, I suppose. Certainly,” said Nanase.
“Plus, if you and Housen-kun were to oppose one another,
it’s possible your class would end up fracturing in two rather than
being united as one. We cannot allow that to happen. So how
about you allow me to help you change his mind?” said Horikita.
Apparently, this conversation with Nanase had helped
Horikita to realize something as well—that as long as we got
Housen, the rest of our problems would be solved.
“It’s a risky gamble. If it fails, it might not be possible for our
classes to collaborate again in the future,” said Nanase.
“I am prepared for that… Well, no, that’s not quite right. I
believe that it’s entirely possible that we can work with one
another. And it’s not just me, either. I’m sure Housen-kun is
thinking the same thing,” said Horikita.
“Even though he spoke to you so rudely over the phone
before?” said Nanase.
“I’ll just take that as him playing hard to get. At least for
now.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_223">
<p>Nanase seemed to understand what Horikita was trying to
say. She quickly voiced her agreement.
“I see that making time to meet with you today was the
correct choice, Horikita-senpai, Ayanokouji-senpai. It would seem
my hunch wasn’t wrong, after all.”
“What do you mean? I rejected your proposal, didn’t I?” said
Horikita.
“No, you didn’t. Actually, you and I have been of the same
mind from the very beginning, Horikita-senpai,” said Nanase.
“Wait… Do you mean to say that you’ve been thinking of
trying to persuade him, too?” asked Horikita.
“Correct,” said Nanase.
Apparently, the idea Nanase had pitched, about her
becoming a leader, was completely made up. It was a test. If
Horikita had chosen to ignore Class 1-D’s future for the short-term
profit of our own class, and taken Nanase up on her offer, she
probably would’ve turned around and refused to help us.
“Just as you said yourself earlier, we do not have time,
Horikita-senpai. We cannot move forward unless we bring
everyone together to negotiate, even if that means we need to be
a little forceful. Would you please allow me to handle setting up
this meeting? I will be sure to bring Housen-kun to you the day
after tomorrow, on Sunday, Horikita-senpai,” said Nanase.
It didn’t seem like a test this time, considering she was
bowing deeply and asking Horikita for help. If this meeting took
place on Sunday, it would mean we’d have even less time
remaining, as a result.
Horikita turned her gaze towards me, looking for
confirmation. Thinking it was all right to take this gamble, I
nodded in response. The hesitation in her eyes vanished.
“I believe you. I look forward to seeing you and Housen-kun
the day after tomorrow, on Sunday,” said Horikita.
“Yes… Absolutely. However, we would like to avoid meeting
in a public place. It’s quite possible that Housen-kun might act out
indiscriminately, depending on how things go,” said Nanase.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_224">
<p>“Yes, I suppose you’re right. In that case, karaoke might be a
good place for us to meet. I don’t mind meeting at night either, if
Housen-kun wishes,” said Horikita.
It was certainly true that meeting late at night on a Sunday
would substantially lower the risk of being seen by anyone.
“Understood. I’ll be sure to let him know,” said Nanase.
Just as the conversation got to a point where our plans were
taking shape, Horikita’s phone rang. She looked at the message
she’d received and let out a sigh.
“What’s up?” I asked.
“It’s time for the study group. It seems like they’re short on
people, with me not there,” said Horikita.
It had already gotten to be five thirty before I even realized
it.
“I think that we’ve wrapped things up here. Can I ask you to
handle the rest?” asked Horikita.
“Sure.”
Horikita gave Nanase a quick, polite bow, then gathered up
her things and headed to the study group with our classmates.
Trying to support our entire class required her to run all over the
place and do all kinds of things.
“She is quite busy, isn’t she? Horikita-senpai, I mean,” said
Nanase.
“That’s what it’s like to keep a class together,” I told her.
“I hope I can become as impressive as her a year from
now…”
“Horikita didn’t ask for any details, but just wondering—how
do you intend to draw Housen out, anyway?” I asked.
“Well… I’m happy to answer that question, Ayanokouji-
senpai, but I’d like you to tell me something about yourself.”
“Something about me?”
The sun was starting to set outside, the world glowing a
brilliant orange color.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_225">
<p>“Horikita-senpai is the class leader. But you’re different,
aren’t you, Ayanokouji-senpai?” asked Nanase.
I see. It seemed Nanase wasn’t sure I was the appropriate
person to be here right now. If I said I was only here because
Horikita forced me to come along with her, it would probably
backfire and cause Nanase to clam up.
“Senpai… What kind of person are you?” she asked.
When I didn’t answer her questions, Nanase propped her
arm on the desk in front of her, showing me her side profile. It
looked like some kind of defensive strategy on her part, to prevent
anyone but me from reading her facial expression and mouth
movements.
“Can you please answer me?” she asked.
“Well, Nanase, it sounds like what you want to ask me isn’t
what kind of relationship I have with Horikita,” I replied.
She was asking something entirely different. She was asking
me what kind of human being I am.
“That’s right. I believe you’re an evil, disgusting human
being, Ayanokouji-senpai. That’s what I think,” said Nanase.
Those were some incredibly dramatic, intense words that she
hurled at me. But despite the content of her statement, Nanase
looked straight at me without hesitation, and with almost an
overabundance of honesty. I honestly had no idea what I’d done to
make her look at me like that. Considering all the interaction we’d
had so far, she should only have had trivial, surface-level
information about me.
Also, despite the issues that arose from my lack of chemistry
with people, I didn’t recall ever having been called evil before.
Nanase Tsubasa might be the person I was looking for. The one
sent from the White Room.
There were reasons why I thought that. Even though getting
me expelled was the most important directive for the agent, it
wasn’t like they would carry that task out routinely or robotically.
Rather, they’d come into close contact with the person known as
Ayanokouji Kiyotaka and observe him. That was what I thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_226">
<p>They wouldn’t just want to get me expelled. They would want to
prove that they were definitively better than me.
Well, I supposed that if they didn’t do as much, he would
never approve of them.
If I were on their side and had to get Ayanokouji Kiyotaka
expelled, I would probably think that way. However, what she’d
just said to me also sounded rather out of character for someone
who came from the White Room, like I did.
“When I’m talking with you like this, you look like a normal
person to me, Ayanokouji-senpai,” said Nanase.
“Does that mean you usually see me as someone who isn’t
normal?” I asked in return.
“…No. That’s not what I’m saying,” said Nanase.
She denied it, but I wondered if that was what she really
thought, deep down. I’d run into Nanase four times now, and
sensed her giving me a strange look in each of those encounters. I
felt like I was about to find out where her loyalties lay, but the
opportunity quickly slipped from my grasp.
“I’m sorry, but please just forget we ever talked about this.
What’s important right now is whether our classes can cooperate
with one another,” said Nanase.
We both got up from our seats and left the library. Just as we
were about to go our separate ways, I remembered something I
had wanted to ask her.
“Oh, come to think of it, when we were talking about losing
three months’ worth of Private Points, you said you’d only lose two
hundred and forty thousand. Why is that, anyway?” I asked.
When I asked her that question, Nanase no longer wore the
expression she had only moments before. Her face was back to
normal.
“Why? I simply calculated that if we were to retain the eight
hundred Class Points which we were granted when we started
school here, then we would end up with two hundred and forty
thousand points as a result is all…” she said, sounding perplexed.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_227">
<p>Apparently, this year’s batch of new students had a different
starting line than we did.
“Last year, we were given a total of a thousand Class Points
at first,” I told her.
“Huh? So, you’re saying that we were given two hundred
points less, then?”
“That’s exactly what I’m saying. I wonder what things are
like for Class A and Class B in your grade level.”
“I think that they started with eight hundred points as well.
That was how Shiba-sensei explained things to us,” said Nanase.
Why wasn’t there any official notification put out for that,
though? I imagined that if you knew that you were being given
fewer Class Points than previous years had gotten, you would feel
like it was a little unfair. Did the school officials simply decide that
it wasn’t worth showing that much consideration for the new
students, because they felt like eighty thousand Private Points was
quite a lot of money as is?
No—even if that were the case, they should have informed
everyone right at the start, rather than try to hide it out of laziness
and risk having students find out and come back to complain
about it later. The students would have been more satisfied if they
had put out some statement ahead of time. There were a number
of other things that we knew were different from how they were
last year.
“You do know that what you do every day has an effect on
your Class Points, right?” I told her.
The homeroom instructor for Class 1-D, Shiba-sensei, had
said something earlier that made me think they already knew. He
said, “I’m also quite sure that the school rules have been drilled
into you so much by now that your head feels like it could
explode.”
“Yes. We were told that, ‘Tardiness, absences, and chatting
during class time will influence your Class Points,’” replied Nanase.
Was it possible that the school had reduced the number of
Class Points they were awarded after taking into consideration the</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_228">
<p>fact that they’d gone to the trouble of disclosing the rules to the
new students right at the beginning? We knew that societal
contribution was an important metric in OAA, so even if it was
hidden, the students probably would’ve found out anyway.
Though I was about to tell her that I understood and
accepted her answer, I saw that Nanase was lost in thought for a
bit. Then she got a look on her face like she’d just thought of
something, but only for a moment. Immediately afterward, the
look disappeared. It was a very subtle gesture. I noticed it
precisely because I had met with her quite frequently over the past
few days.
However, since Nanase didn’t say anything, I decided that I’d
refrain from pressing her about it. We walked out of the library
together and made it to the entranceway.
“Well, then, senpai, if you’ll please excuse me,” said Nanase.
Just as she was about to go, though, I called out to her and
stopped her in her tracks.
“Nanase, this isn’t meant as a thank-you for telling me about
the whole Class Points thing earlier or anything, but have you
heard about something called Protection Points?” I asked.
“Protection Points? No, I haven’t heard about those before,”
she answered.
“It’s a system where students who have those Protection
Points can essentially use them to protect themselves from
penalties that would normally end in expulsion. But considering the
fact that very few people in our grade level have them, it’s
understandable that you wouldn’t know about them,” I replied.
“Hm, I see… Why are you telling me this, though?” said
Nanase.
“Because you gave me information. I just thought I should
give you a little bit in return.”
After saying my piece, she and I parted ways.
I had decided to test Nanase’s skills. To see if she could
make use of what I’d just told her.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_229">
<p>6.4
 
ALTHOUGH IT HAD TAKEN some time for everything to come
together, it was decided that we were going to have a discussion
with Housen (albeit forcefully), thanks to Nanase’s dedicated
cooperation. The situation was still entirely unpredictable, but it
was still a definite step forward.
A little before six o’clock that evening, my doorbell rang. Kei
must have only just gotten back to the dorms from the school
building, because she was wearing her uniform, not her regular
clothes.
“You know, there’s lots of people coming and going at this
time of day, so I had to be pretty careful. Like, I had to use the
stairs and stuff,” said Kei.
There probably weren’t many girls who’d be coming to a
boy’s room, and even fewer who would visit for an extended
period of time. That kind of thing didn’t happen often unless a guy
and a girl were dating.
“All right, let’s get started, then,” I told her.
“Huh?! Come on, aren’t we like, gonna do some other stuff
first?” wailed Kei.
She didn’t take out her study materials. It sounded like she
had wanted to chat instead. But time was limited. The later it got,
the less time there would be to study.
“If there are no problems with your academics, then we can
chat as much as you want,” I told her.
“Hmph…”
“First of all, we need to find out what you’re good at and
what you’re not so good at.”
“How are you going to find that out?” asked Kei.
“With these,” I replied.
I took out five test sheets. Keisei had made them for our
group, to check what everyone’s strengths and weaknesses were.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_230">
<p>They were extremely useful to have, considering how much time it
would’ve taken to have carefully screen through the number of
questions needed to get things started. Horikita and Yousuke had
used these sample tests in their own study groups, too.
“Most of our classmates have already been tested with
these,” I told her.
“Oh…”
“There’s a ten-minute time limit per sheet. Go ahead and get
started.”
“Fine,” she huffed.
Despite her grumpy response, Kei got started on the tests.
After fifty minutes had passed, she collapsed onto the table like a
limp noodle.
“Ugh, I’m so worn out…!”
“You did good. So you are able to concentrate on regular
tests, after all.”
“Oh come on. I’ve been studying all day today, it’s tiring. It’s
not like I can just flip a switch,” she huffed.
As she grumbled, I quickly finished grading her tests.
“Okay. I think I have a good understanding of what your
abilities are, Kei,” I told her.
“H-how’d I do?” she asked.
She didn’t seem to know that herself, because she was
looking at me with eyes filled with both expectation and
anxiousness.
“You will definitely be going to Yousuke’s study group from
tomorrow,” I told her.
“What?!”
“There’s nothing to panic about. But to be honest, if you
don’t keep up your studies, you’ll be in imminent danger of getting
expelled.”
“B-But, hold on, my partner’s Shimazaki-san. He’s got a B
minus, right? So, I’ll be okay, won’t I?” asked Kei.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_231">
<p>“The passing score for this special exam is five hundred and
one points. Someone like you, Kei, who doesn’t study enough,
would probably get about two hundred points, give or take.
Whereas Shimazaki would probably get around three hundred and
fifty. It’s hard to imagine that getting an assumed total of only five
hundred and fifty points puts you entirely in the clear. And on top
of that, if this Shimazaki dislikes studying like you do, then it’s
actually quite possible that he could end up scoring less than three
hundred points,” I told her.
And if that were to happen, there was a very good chance
that she would fall below that five-hundred-point threshold.
“I’m starting to feel really scared all of a sudden…” said Kei
quietly.
“Which is why it’s important we get you to a place where you
can definitely get a score of two hundred and fifty points on the
test, as soon as possible.”
This test was designed in such a way that even a D+ student
should be able to score that well if they studied efficiently.
“Um, hey, I kinda have a question, though,” said Kei.
“A question?”
“I mean, you’re gonna tutor me and all, but don’t you have a
C in academic ability, Kiyotaka? So, doesn’t that mean you’re
average? But I bet in reality, you like… You can do way better than
that, can’t you?” said Kei.
“Something like that.”
“It’s just like how you’re really good at fighting, too. Why do
you hide it all so much?” asked Kei.
“I don’t want to stand out. So I don’t try to get high scores is
all,” I replied.
“Okay, so, like, how many points do you think you could get
if you were serious about it?” asked Kei.
“No idea.”
“Come on, don’t mess with me. Just tell me!” said Kei,
forcefully but playfully pushing my shoulder and smiling at me as</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_232">
<p>she pleaded.
“I’ll be more than happy to answer your question if you show
up and put in the work at the study group from tomorrow onward.”
“I’ll go, totally. I feel, like, a sense of impending danger from
what you just told me,” she admitted.
“Instead of telling you how many points I can get, though,
I’ll tell you how many points I’ve decided I’m going to get,” I told
her.
“Wh-what’s that supposed to mean? That’s a pretty
incredible claim to make,” said Kei.
There were a total of five subjects. I had no intention of
slacking off in any individual subject, considering I had to compete
against Horikita in one. However, if I actually put everything I had
into each subject, then my reputation amongst my peers would
change dramatically.
“Four hundred points,” I told her.
“…Wait, for real? Four hundred points, that’s definitely…”
“The equivalent of an A rank.”
That was a level only a select few bright students in our
class, like Horikita and Keisei, could reach. It would’ve been more
accurate for me to have said near four hundred points, but there
was probably no need to amend my statement now.
“A-and you’re saying that you can get that score if you want
to?” asked Kei.
“Of course. There hasn’t been a single problem that I
thought I couldn’t solve since I enrolled here.”
I didn’t know how many highly difficult questions would be
included in this exam, but compared to the kind of studies I’d
undergone in the White Room, it seemed fair to assume it was
going to be pretty easy. Noticing Kei seemed to have a blank look
on her face, unable to understand what I was just telling her, I
decided to pull her back down to Earth.
“Now that you can see the big picture, I want you to keep
that sense of impending danger in mind, and focus,” I told her.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_233">
<p>“Okay… I guess I’ll study here for a bit and head back to my
room then…”
It was only a little after seven at night, so there was nothing
wrong with her sticking around for another hour or so. It would
also be helpful for me, so that I could tell Yousuke more clearly
what kind of level Kei was at tomorrow.
“Okay. Well, then, let’s get started right away.”.
“Hey, over here,” said Kei.
“Hm?”
I had intended to get started while we sat across from one
another, but Kei lightly patted the floor next to her.
“Tutor me from right here, next to me,” said Kei.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_234">
<p>6.5
 
WE SPENT A LITTLE OVER an hour together in my room. During
that time, I gave Kei advice while she studied. I got the impression
that she fundamentally had a good head on her shoulders, but the
fact that she hadn’t taken her studies seriously all this time was
holding her back. I didn’t plan to point that out to her, though.
If Kei had just been neglecting her studies from an early
stage, I could’ve admonished her over it, but in her case, it was
the abuse she had suffered in junior high that had prevented her
from getting a legitimate education. So because she didn’t properly
learn the ‘basics’ in junior high, she was struggling in her classes in
high school. When I considered all of that, I’d say she was actually
doing quite well.
Guiding her with compassion and giving her advice was
probably the correct decision. If she could come to feel that
studying wasn’t a painful experience, she might even start growing
and maturing in a big way, just like Sudou.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_235">
<img src="https://cote12.ct.ws/14.jpg">
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_236">
<p>“Um…”
“What’s up?” I asked.
Kei suddenly started looking down at the floor. Then, after
what seemed like a few seconds of continued staring at the floor,
she reached out and grabbed something.
I had thought maybe a small piece of garbage or some dust
was laying there or something, but…
“What… is this?” asked Kei, holding her arm out to show me
something she was holding between her index finger and thumb.
It was a single strand of long red hair.
“Looks like a hair,” I replied.
When I came right out and said what I thought, Kei’s face
gradually transformed more and more into that of a raging
demon’s.
“A red hair! And…and…it’s a long one! No matter how you
look at it, it’s gotta be a girl’s hair!” she shouted.
Well, yeah, she was probably right about that. It was
physically impossible for that to be my hair, considering the length.
And my hair also had a completely different quality to it, of course.
The person the hair belonged to immediately sprang to mind.
It had to be Amasawa Ichika, who had made me cook for her the
other day.
“Who did you have over?!” asked Kei.
She was probably asking me because she had no idea who it
could have come from, out of our classmates or others.
“Wait, is this that thing? Jealousy…?” I asked.
“Well, is that a bad thing?! I’m your girlfriend, Kiyotaka! I
have the right to keep an eye on you when it comes to this stuff!”
This was the first time I had heard of a right like that. In any
case, I supposed there was one lesson I should take from this.
Namely, after inviting a girl into your room, you should clean
thoroughly.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_237">
<p>I’d thought the lesson would end there, but the disaster was
still ongoing. While I was racking my brain over how best to
explain myself, my doorbell rang without warning. The sound
echoed throughout my room. And then, an image of the lobby was
displayed on the monitor.
I, the resident of this room, wasn’t the only one curious
about who had just rung my bell. Kei was, too. We both peeked at
the video on the monitor.
On the screen, we saw the figure of Amasawa, waving, with
a big grin on her face. The first person to react wasn’t me, but
rather, Kei, still clutching the red hair in her hand.
“Red hair. A girl I haven’t seen before…” she muttered.
It was almost like she was solving a mystery on a children’s
detective show. Kei reached out and pressed the call button before
I could do it myself.
“Hello, who is it?!” asked Kei, her voice containing rather
overt tones of anger.
Amasawa was, of course, visibly surprised.
“Huh? Wait, this is… room four-oh-one, right? Ayanokouji-
senpai’s room?” she said.
I forcefully pulled Kei’s arm away, and I took over.
“Sorry. It’s me. What do you want?” I asked.
She was an unexpected visitor, but I couldn’t just let Kei deal
with it. Putting the matter of Amasawa aside, there was also the
problem of people coming and going in the lobby being able to
hear that Kei and I were together.
“Oh, is someone there with you? Should I come back later?
There was something I wanted to talk to you about, so I thought
I’d drop by,” said Amasawa.
Even though Kei was glaring at me, she gestured for me to
let her come on up, rather than turning her away. Apparently, she
wanted to be certain the hair belonged to Amasawa.
“Nah, it’s okay. Come on up,” I told her.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_238">
<p>I pushed the unlock button and let Amasawa come in
through the lobby.
“Are you sure this is okay? Other students are going to know
you’re here,” I said to Kei.
“…Oh.”
Apparently, she’d gotten so angry that the blood rushed to
her head and she lost track of things. Kei was the one who’d told
me we should keep the fact that we were boyfriend and girlfriend
a secret from everyone else for now, still. If we casually bumped
into someone else while together, there was a chance rumors of
that sort might start going around.
“Well, it’s a little late for all that. We’ll just have to try and
hide it,” said Kei.
In any case, Amasawa had already heard Kei’s voice, and
rushing to get rid of her wouldn’t really have much of an effect. In
fact, we had to consider the possibility that doing so would lead to
some strange speculation.
About a minute or so later, Amasawa must have reached the
fourth floor. The doorbell for my room rang.
“I’ll let her in, so just sit here and wait for now,” I told Kei.
“O-… Okay.”
I went to my front door and welcomed Amasawa.
“Sorry for dropping by so suddenly, Ayanokouji-senpai,” said
Amasawa.
After examining the look on my face, she took a look at the
shoes near the entranceway, in calculating fashion. How to put
it…? The way she looked around the room… It seemed like what
they called a woman’s intuition.
“Girlfriend?” said Amasawa, asking me straight out, with a
big grin.
“What do you want?” I asked.
“Aww, you didn’t bite. Well, to tell you the truth, senpai, I
think I might have forgotten something in your room.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_239">
<p>“You forgot something?” I repeated.
“My favorite hair tie. I can’t seem to find it anywhere…”
So she’d come by my room after realizing it had gone
missing, huh?
“In that case, come on in,” I told her.
I couldn’t exactly make her just stand there and wait, so I
decided to let her come inside. I thought it would be quicker to let
Amasawa explain things than for me to try to come up with petty
excuses about the hair.
“Sorry to barge in like this!” Amasawa entered my room,
completely unconcerned about the presence of the other guest
who had arrived before her. She must have been on her way back
from school, because she still had her book bag in her hands.
She then came face to face with Kei, who had been sitting
and waiting.
“Oh, hello! I’m Amasawa Ichika,” she said.
“Hi.” Kei looked clearly unhappy about this, but she seemed
like she was putting up with it, in her own way.
“Oh, you’re my senpai too, right? I’d love to know your
name.”
“…Karuizawa Kei.”
“Karuizawa-senpai, huh? Oh, looks like you two were
studying together. Are you his girlfriend, by any chance?
Ayanokouji-senpai dodged the question earlier when I tried asking
him, so I wanted to try again,” said Amasawa.
It was a bit of a gift to be able to just come right out and ask
whatever you wanted, without hesitation.
“That’s really none of your business, is it? Actually, hold on,
what about you? What’s your relationship with Kiyotaka?” asked
Kei.
Although the fact that Kei called me by my first name
naturally made Amasawa suspect even more that there was
something going on, she looked around my room.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_240">
<p>“I’ll answer your question in just a sec, so hold on, okay?
Hmm… I don’t see it anywhere at first glance. I’m sure I took it off
when I was last here, though. Hmm… Maybe it rolled along the
floor somewhere?” said Amasawa.
Paying absolutely no mind to Kei glaring at her, she got down
on her knees, trying to peek under the bed. As she did so, her skirt
rode up, naturally accentuating her rear end, which was positioned
facing us.
“Oh… senpai? I feel like this might look a little bit naughty,”
teased Amasawa, looking back at us. Her tone suggested she was
doing it on purpose.
Kei reacted quickly and immediately, turning her head to
direct her glare at me.
“I’ll try looking for it,” I told them.
I started searching, seeing if the hair tie had gotten under
the bed somehow.
“Hey, can you not ignore me? Answer the question,” said Kei.
“Hmm, let’s see, I guess Ayanokouji-senpai is my… Hm,
what’s the best way to put it? My personal chef?” said Amasawa.
“Huh? Wait, what?” Kei, unable to understand what she was
talking about, looked over at me once again. And she was glaring
at me more intensely than she was moments before.
“She’s Sudou’s partner. Some stuff happened, and we
became acquainted. I ended up serving her a meal once,” I told
Kei.
“Okay, sorry, but I really don’t get what you’re saying at all.
Why did you cook for Sudou-kun’s partner?” asked Kei.
Well, considering she’d only heard the general outline of
what happened, it was understandable she’d be confused. I
responded by explaining the situation more in depth, while
continuing to search for the hair tie underneath the bed.
“Oh, can I go and look in the kitchen too, just in case? I
might have taken it off there when I was washing dishes. Oh, but</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_241">
<p>please keep looking in the room yourself, senpai. Like maybe under
the closet or something?” said Amasawa.
“All right.”
I didn’t find anything under the bed, so I started looking
around the closet next. Kei then came up close to me.
“Wait, hold on a second… This whole thing about her hair tie
maybe being here… What is that supposed to mean?!” said Kei, in
a hushed voice, trying to confirm what was going on.
“I already told you. I invited Amasawa over and cooked a
meal for her the one time. That’s all.”
“I-is that really all that happened?” said Kei.
“Of course it is,” I answered.
“…Really?” she asked.
It seemed like even if I said as much, she wasn’t going to
believe me so easily.
“I’m gonna check with that girl and make sure that’s true,”
said Kei.
Just as she tried to stand back up, though, I forcefully
grabbed her arm. Then, I quickly brought my index finger up to
my lips and gestured to her to be quiet. Kei was quick on the
uptake at times like this, and didn’t cause any fuss.
“I want you to search the area too,” I told her.
“O-Okay,” she replied.
Even though she didn’t understand my intentions, she
seemed to understand that it was important, and she started
helping me search.
“Oh! Ayanokouji-senpai, it’s here!” said Amasawa, her voice
echoing from the kitchen.
When Kei and I both peeked into the kitchen at the same
time, Amasawa showed us the hair tie, held in the palm of her
hand.
“Looks like it fell in the gap between the counter and the
fridge,” she said, smiling happily as she spoke, tucking the item</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_242">
<p>into her pocket. “Anyway, it feels like I kinda got in the middle of
something here, so I’ll be going now.”
“Sorry for all the commotion,” I told her.
“No, it’s okay. I shouldn’t have forgotten it in the first place.
Anyway, sorry again about bothering you!” said Amasawa, quickly
grabbing her bag and putting on her shoes in the entranceway.
“But y’know, you really are a smooth operator, senpai, aren’t you?
I never imagined you’d have yourself such a cute girlfriend.”
She put a finger up against her cheek, as if pretending to
think something over.
“Yeah, come to think of it, that’s a good point. Next time I
have you cook for me, it might not be a good idea for us to be
alone together,” she added.
“Obviously!” yelled Kei.
“In that case… Karuizawa-senpai will just have to eat with
us, then. Anyway, goodbye!” said Amasawa.
She arrived like a whirlwind and departed in the same
manner.
“Seems like you’ve gotten acquainted with a pretty cute
kouhai, huh, Kiyotaka?” said Kei.
“You’re probably not going to listen to me no matter what I
say, are you?”
The atmosphere was no longer conducive to tutoring. I
couldn’t do anything but explain what had really happened over
and over to Kei until she was satisfied.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_243">

FRIDAY CAME AND WENT, and now Saturday, our day off, was
here. I’d had many opportunities to interact with the younger
students during the week as a result of the special exam. There
was my encounter with Amasawa from Class 1-A, which in turn led
me to having to make her a home-cooked meal to secure a partner
for Sudou. Then there were the discussions with Nanase regarding
entering into an agreement with Class 1-D.
Other than what was going on with me, Kushida had had a
discussion with Yagami from Class 1-B. Thanks to Kushida asking
him to introduce people to some of his friends, we had managed
to secure partnerships for Kei and other students in our class.
While the importance of this special exam depended on your point
of view, I was sure it would be deeply significant in terms of
interaction between grade levels. Many students already knew the
names and faces of the students in the grade above or below
them, and even knew what kind of grades they had.
We had also ascertained what kind of tendencies each class
had. Class 1-A did not have a clear leader at the moment. I got the
impression each student was essentially free to do what they
wanted. One of the reasons they were allowed to do so was the
class’s overall excellent grades. True to their name, they had the
highest number of students with a B- or better out of the four
classes in their grade level.
Many of the more academically inclined students had already
individually negotiated their own terms with Class 2-A or 2-C, using
points. And though there were naturally some students in their
class who had been classified as D- in terms of academic ability,
they were also picked up by Class 2-A because they excelled in
other areas. Of the forty students in Class 1-A, thirty-four had
already confirmed partnerships.
Class 1-B exhibited similar trends to A, in that they still didn’t
have a clear leader. Also, the good students were selling
themselves off individually one after another. The difference was</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_244">
<p>that most of these partnerships weren’t with Class 2-A, but with
Class 2-C. I wondered if that was due to the fact that Ryuuen and
his ilk were offering a larger sum of points than Sakayanagi was.
The exact details of the situation were unclear at the moment, but
currently, thirty-three of their students had settled on partners.
As for Class 1-D, Housen had total control, ruling his class
with an iron fist. If I had to compare it to anything in our year, I’d
say it was almost exactly the same as how Ryuuen used to do
things. What was interesting to me was that Class D was also the
class with the least number of partnerships out of everyone. We
would probably find out more details when we meet on Sunday.
And finally, there was Class 1-C. The class I had hardly
interacted with at all over the past week. I had already committed
the names of their students to memory, but their class had never
come up in conversation, not even from Horikita. What was the
primary reason for this? Well, it was the meet-and-greet event
spearheaded by Ichinose from Class 2-B. As a result of that, many
students from their class had confirmed partnership agreements.
Ten students from their class still hadn’t finalized their
partnerships yet, but of those ten, none had a D- or lower in
academic ability. In other words, almost everyone in their class had
successfully managed to secure a safe position. Perhaps there was
someone helping organize things within their class, and they had
successfully managed to save their classmates by way of the meet-
and-greet event.
Just past noon, I booted up the OAA app, and looked up the
partnerships that had been formed as of today.
“A hundred and five partnerships formed. Close to seventy
percent then, huh?”
If you looked at the number of people in the library
yesterday, you could see most students had wanted to get things
wrapped up before the weekend. There was more movement in
Class 1-D, and now a total of eight students from their class had
confirmed partnerships. I wasn’t sure if the fact that it was the
weekend now was making Housen impatient…</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_245">
<p>Well, at any rate, the remaining number of first-year students
who hadn’t yet picked a partner was fifty-five, and for second-
years, fifty-two. If there was a White Room agent hiding among
those remaining students, then the odds of me getting partnered
with them were pretty high. To be honest, there was no guarantee
that I wasn’t going to end up choosing the White Room student,
because they weren’t showing themselves at all.
I’d been dragging things out, hoping something would
present itself along the way so that I could determine if someone
were a safe choice or not, but I was reaching my limit now. I was
going to need to decide before my options dwindled down even
further.
Though we were close to negotiating with Class 1-D, I
wanted to have other options available to me. I decided to head
over to Keyaki Mall on Saturday afternoon to expand my
possibilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_246">
<p>6.7
 
NATURALLY, THE MALL on a Saturday was positively packed with
students, particularly ones who’d already confirmed their
partnerships for the special exam. Since they had no need to panic
in that regard anymore, they were just studying with their friends
in preparation for the written exam next week, and having fun, to
relax a bit. I hadn’t come into contact with any first-year students
yet, but even so, I felt like if there was a White Room agent
nearby, I would’ve encountered them.
Still, I didn’t have a gut feeling that anyone I had met was
the agent. If I had to pick one example of such a feeling, I’d have
to say it was the feeling I got back when I was talking with Nanase
in the library. Most likely, Tsukishiro or someone else close to them
had thoroughly taught the agent how to really act like a “student.”
The problem wasn’t whether they had a personality with some
quirks or not. The problem was whether they could completely
mask the scent that betrayed them as someone from the White
Room.
I’d been in a comparable situation myself a year ago, when I
first came to this school. There were disadvantages and drawbacks
of being raised without any knowledge of the world. Namely, I
didn’t know what it was like to be a student at all. That was
naturally something we weren’t taught in the White Room, as they
had never intended for us to be sent to school.
Which was why, after coming here, I had briefly tried coming
up with a character that I could “act out” appropriately. I tried
various things, like being more talkative than I usually was and
changing my tone of voice. Being a somewhat cocky student with
a kind of cynical, shrewd view of the world. Well…
In the end, I found it kind of tedious to put on an act, so I
quickly went back to being my regular self. Because I had come to
realize that I could still be a “student” here without hiding my
original self.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_247">
<p>But the person the White Room had sent in now was
different. They were putting up a front, camouflaging themselves
as a student to prevent me from finding out their true identity. I
had no idea if they were playing the part of a quirky student or if
they were playing a blank slate. Either way, I probably wasn’t
going to see through their act all that easily. Anyone who had
managed to survive in that world could not be underestimated,
regardless of their gender.
Even though I was confident I could win when it came to
individual skill, I was in an overwhelmingly disadvantageous
position due to essentially being forced to go on the defensive. My
opponent could get me expelled in any way they chose, while the
only thing I could do was defend myself by trying to detect what
they were planning.
After I finished dropping into Humming and was on my way
back, I happened to bump into Sakayanagi.
“My, it seems you’re being quite proactive in engaging with
the new students, hm? Ayanokouji-kun?”
“Well, that’s because this exam leaves students with low
scores no choice but to fight desperately for their lives. I’m just
helping Horikita find partners for Sudou and Ike.”
“I see. It’s certainly true that if either of those two drew the
short straw, so to speak, and ended up with a poor excuse for a
partner, expulsion would be imminent.” Sakayanagi seemed to
accept what I’d said, but our conversation didn’t end there. “But is
that really all there is to it?”
“Meaning what?” I asked in return.
“Well, I was wondering if perhaps…the White Room, or
something similar to it, had sent in an assassin among the first-
year students to get you expelled, Ayanokouji-kun? Even if you
were to get a perfect score on the exam, if your partner got zero
points, then both you and your partner would be expelled. I hope
you don’t mind my saying this, but I just happened to let my
imagination run wild about this special exam, and came to the
conclusion it might be particularly troublesome for you,” said
Sakayanagi.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_248">
<p>I tried to play dumb, but this sounded like it was more than
just an idea that had popped into Sakayanagi’s head as a mere
possibility. She spoke as if she had known from the very beginning
that such a scenario was inevitable.
“You can’t possibly continue to live a quiet life here at this
school forever, can you? If your opponent were so inclined, they
certainly wouldn’t mind making your true abilities known to
everyone, Ayanokouji-kun. Though I suppose if you can maintain
an enjoyable life here at school regardless, this will all prove to be
needless apprehension on my part,” she added.
“Well, you don’t have to worry about that.”
“May I inquire as to your reasoning for saying so?”
“I’m going to abandon my old way of thinking. The way I’ve
been thinking until now. I’m not planning on holding back
anymore.”
Right now, continuing my life here at this school was my top
priority. If I kept doing things halfway, I might find the rug pulled
out right from under me.
“I see. Well, I suppose you’ve shown some of your abilities to
Mashima-sensei, so it might be more convenient for you to boldly
go ahead and lay everything bare now,” replied Sakayanagi,
apparently quite thrilled to hear this. “Well then, I’ll get right to the
point. If you haven’t settled on a partner for yourself as of yet,
may I lend you my assistance to save you the trouble? I have only
a vague idea, mind you, but there are certainly some first-year
students still available who come to mind. They are children who
will not adversely affect you, should they offer to partner with you,
Ayanokouji-kun.”
It sounded as though Sakayanagi had gone to the trouble of
doing some digging herself, trying to determine which students
were safe choices for me.
“That’s very generous of you. But I’ll have to decline your
offer,” I replied.
“Do you not trust my judgment?” she asked in return.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_249">
<p>She had already seen right through me quite some time ago.
She knew I needed to come to a decision soon.
“I acknowledge your abilities. But I’ll be the one to decide
my own fate.”
If I failed after entrusting my fate to someone else, I’d have
nothing left but regret.
“Besides, I have a pretty good idea of how I’m going to fight
this,” I added.
“Oh, is that so? Well then, I will refrain from saying anything
uncouth. I will watch you from afar to see how you acquit yourself
in this battle, Ayanokouji-kun. And I look forward to the day we
can fight again in the near future,” said Sakayanagi, bowing to me
before walking off somewhere.
She didn’t even consider me getting expelled a possibility. In
that sense, I supposed she had immense faith in me, huh?</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_250">
<p>6.8
 
WHILE I WAS ON MY WAY BACK to the dorms from Keyaki Mall, I
heard a somewhat slow, strained voice call out to me from behind.
“Excuse me, do you have a minute?”
When I turned around, I saw a boy and a girl staring back at
me. The girl seemed to be alternating looking at me and looking at
her phone. She was Tsubaki Sakurako, from Class 1-C. Her
companion was from the same class. His name was Utomiya Riku.
“You’re…Ayanokouji-senpai, from Class 2-D, right?”
I couldn’t see the screen of the girl’s phone because of the
angle, but she most likely had the OAA app open.
“My name is Utomiya, and her name is Tsubaki. May we talk
with you about a partnership?” asked Utomiya.
“About a partnership?” I repeated.
“Yes. We’re going around looking for senpai with Cs or higher
in academic ability, to see if anyone can help us,” he replied.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_251">
<img src="https://cote12.ct.ws/15.jpg">
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_252">
<p>Since I had been out and about looking for a partner myself,
this felt too good to be true. It was almost like they were waiting
for me to show up. Should I see someone who blatantly walked up
to me as dangerous? Or conversely, should I see them as safe?
Well, no—the most dangerous thing would be for me to make a
judgment based on the issue of their timing alone.
“I’ve been having a pretty tough time finding a partner
myself. Can you tell me a little bit more?” I asked.
With the app, you could understand what a student looked
like and what their name was, as well as what grades they had.
But you couldn’t get a sense of their personality, which was
precisely why it was necessary to meet face-to-face, so that each
party could determine if the other was trustworthy.
Incidentally, Utomiya had already found a partner, but
Tsubaki had yet to find one for herself. Her academic ability
certainly wasn’t high. Only a C-. I was sure she wanted to be
partnered up with someone who had a C or better. It seemed
these two were out together looking for someone from my grade
level with a C or higher, but were they looking to help Tsubaki find
a partner? Or were they looking for someone for another
classmate?
“I’d prefer not to stand around here and chat though. How
about we talk at the café?” Utomiya took the lead in the
conversation, speaking to me quite respectfully and suggesting we
talk somewhere else.
This definitely wasn’t something that could be decided upon
in a minute or two, so I accepted his proposal to change venues.
It was crowded, but we found an empty space in the corner
of the café and sat down there.
“I apologize for being hasty, but we’d like to get right into it,
if you don’t mind,” said Utomiya. He then looked over at Tsubaki
and motioned for her to speak up.
“I don’t like having to owe anyone anything, and I don’t like
anyone having to owe me anything. I’m not a fan of debts. So, I
want a relationship that won’t come back to bite me,” said Tsubaki,</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_253">
<p>looking at her nails as she spoke. She sounded both laid-back and
candid.
It was true there was little difference between a C- and a C,
meaning the person with the higher ranking couldn’t really feel
superior in such a situation.
“Can I ask you something that’s been bothering me?” I asked
in return.
“Yes, go ahead,” said Utomiya.
“The majority of students are around C rank. Why didn’t she
find a partner sooner, then?”
Sure, you wouldn’t get a high score that way, but you could
avoid getting expelled. I was sure some second-years would have
gladly partnered with Tsubaki. The fact that she remained available
all this time, through the first half of the exam period, was
worrisome.
“Well—”
Utomiya started to speak, but then went silent for a moment,
the words getting stuck in his throat. Upon noticing him struggling,
Tsubaki turned and looked at me, actually making eye contact for
the first time during this entire conversation.
“That’s my bad. I never said anything,” said Tsubaki.
Utomiya used what she said as a starting point and
supplemented it with his own explanation. “Tsubaki didn’t talk to
anyone about finding a partner. I’m guessing she got impatient
once Friday rolled around, because she came up to me for the first
time and asked me what she should do…”
So, Tsubaki’s classmate Utomiya had begun helping her find
a partner in a race against the clock. It seemed most of the
students in their class had already found partners. Even though
there was still a week left in the exam period, it was
understandable that they’d be panicking.
“Considering Tsubaki’s academic ability, the five percent
penalty could be a problem,” said Utomiya.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_254">
<p>That seemed to be why they had approached me, a student
with a C ranking. If this were a normal situation, I might have
readily agreed to their request. However, there was a reason I
couldn’t just make a snap judgment and say yes to them right off
the bat. That was because what was happening here was strikingly
similar to a scenario I had imagined when the special exam had
just begun. Namely, the fact that the students I had the highest
probability of getting partnered with were people with the same
academic ability ranking as me.
And now Tsubaki, a student with a C- ranking, had come to
me in search of a partner. I had only just met Tsubaki and Utomiya
for the first time. So, the first thing I needed to do was get a feel
for what they were like.
“I wanted to ask you something. You said you were going
around looking for a partner. How many people did you talk to
before you came up to me?” I asked.
I thought I’d start with finding that one. But the response I
got from Utomiya was rather unexpected.
“I’m sorry. I suppose it might have been a bit underhanded
of me to say that. To tell you the truth, you’re the first person
we’ve talked to, Ayanokouji-senpai,” said Utomiya, apologizing to
me directly, as jumping ahead of what I might be speculating. “If
that means you’re not willing to partner with her, Ayanokouji-
senpai, we’ll just look for someone else.”
“Oh, okay. You’re saying that I just happened to be the first
person you talked to, is all.”
“It was a coincidence that we approached you, but there is a
reason you’re the first, Ayanokouji-senpai. We thought if we asked
a student from Class 2-A or 2-C, we might need to strike a deal
using Private Points,” said Utomiya.
I see. It was certainly true that first-year students were
being bought up by second-year students right now. In a situation
like this, if they were to request that someone partner with
Tsubaki, it wouldn’t be surprising if a certain number of points
were involved in the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_255">
<p>But she wasn’t requesting to be partnered with a student
with excellent grades or anything. There were still quite a few
students remaining, so there was probably a good chance she
could easily team up with someone. It was unlikely they hadn’t
already considered all of that.
That being said, it would probably sound a little strange if I
responded to them by saying something like, “I think it’ll be okay,
so why don’t you try Class 2-A or Class C?” Objectively speaking,
there wasn’t a single reason for me to be reluctant to accept the
offer to partner with Tsubaki. The options available to me were
limited.
“I don’t currently have a partner, but I have found a potential
candidate. We’ve discussed things a few times to see if we can
actually work together,” I told them.
What I said was only half true, but there was no way the two
of them could know that for sure. Furthermore, if saying that was
enough to make them back off, it was highly likely that Tsubaki
was a safe choice as a partner.
“Oh, so you have… I see,” replied Utomiya, sounding
somewhat troubled, casting a glance over at Tsubaki.
“In that case, guess there’s nothing we can do, right? It’ll
probably be faster to just start looking for someone else,” said
Tsubaki, deciding to back off as soon as she heard I already had a
candidate in mind.
“Just for reference… What first-year student are you planning
on teaming up with?” asked Utomiya, somewhat insistently, though
Tsubaki herself had already disengaged from the conversation.
“Can’t say. The one thing I can say for sure is it’s not
someone in Class 1-C,” I answered.
Though I didn’t go into detail about the reason I couldn’t tell
them, I was sure they could hazard a guess. Namely that if I were
dealing with someone from a rival class, I couldn’t exactly give out
any information about the student I was working with to a
potential enemy of theirs.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_256">
<p>“Let’s go, Utomiya-kun. We shouldn’t take up any more of
Ayanokouji-senpai’s time,” said Tsubaki.
“…Yes, I suppose so.”
I was grateful they had approached me, but I couldn’t make
a snap decision. I just had far too little data on Sakurako.
“Just in case, here’s my contact info,” said Utomiya, handing
over a piece of paper with his information written on it, which he
must have prepared ahead of time.
“This might be kind of self-serving of me, but if the person
I’m talking with turns down my offer for partnership, I might call
you. If she’s still okay with partnering up with me at that time, I’d
be happy to work something out,” I told them.
“I understand. Let’s go, Tsubaki,” said Utomiya.
Tsubaki uncrossed her arms and stood up from her seat. She
gave me a gentle bow before leaving with Utomiya, probably in
search of other candidates besides me.
“Tsubaki Sakurako and Utomiya Riku. I’ll have to remember
them,” I told myself.
Now that I had thrown away my chance of securing a
partnership right here and now, my actions from this point onward
would be quite important. It wouldn’t be a laughing matter if I
ended up getting partnered with a different student who proved to
be the wrong choice.</p>

TWO GIRLS from Class 2-D walked together, side by side. Me,
Karuizawa Kei, and my friend Satou Maya-san.
Until a few months ago, we used to hang out a lot. But lately,
we’d been seeing each other less and less frequently. Much less
frequently. It wasn’t like we’d quarreled or anything, though. It
was just that, subconsciously, I’d started to feel guilty as of late.
Which made it really hard for me to reach out to her.
“Sorry for calling you out of the blue, Karuizawa-san.”
“Oh, no, it’s totally fine, don’t worry. I was just thinking I
wanted to hang out with you too, Satou-san. Besides, it’s been a
long time since we went out and did anything together, hasn’t it?”
I replied.
“Yeah, definitely, it has! I felt like when we first started here,
we were hanging out like all the time.”
I was walking a little bit ahead of Satou-san. I turned to look
at her and asked what we were going to do today. “So, what’s up?
What do you wanna do? I think it’s kinda early for lunch right
now.”
It was only a little after eleven in the morning right now.
Satou-san had called me and suggested we take a walk together
around Keyaki Mall. However, just as we approached the mall
entrance, she quickly spoke up, sounding kind of flustered.
“Oh, um, hey.”
“What’s up?”
“Can we, um…go this way?” she asked, pointing to the path
that continued on to the school building, in the exact opposite
direction from the mall.
“Wait, toward school? Is there something you need? But
we’ve got the day off today, and I’m pretty sure you can’t go in
wearing casual clothes, right?”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_258">
<p>“I don’t have anything I need at school, but… I just wanted
to go somewhere where there aren’t other people around right
now,” said Satou-san.
I furrowed my brow in confusion, not really understanding
what it was she was trying to say. Well, no, actually. I had an idea
of what this might be about. But I pushed it to the back of my
mind, trying to convince myself that that couldn’t be it. I kept
pretending I didn’t notice anything.
“What’s up, Satou-san? This doesn’t really sound like you.
You feeling okay?” I asked.
“…I just wanted to talk a little bit is all,” she answered.
I had a bad feeling about this, but I couldn’t really turn her
down right now. So I agreed to her request, and the two of us
headed away from the mall and toward the school building.
There wasn’t really anyone around, as you would expect. No
one who might hear our conversation.
“All right, out with it. We are friends, right?” I said, getting
straight to the point.
What I’d just said wasn’t gentle at all. It was cruel. But even
though I was aware of that, I couldn’t stop myself from saying it.
Because I was Karuizawa Kei. The leader of the girls in my class. A
self-centered person who didn’t think about how anyone else felt,
just herself. If I didn’t act that part, everything I’ve done would fall
apart.
I was guessing Satou-san’s mental image of me lined up with
the way I was talking to her now. That was why she didn’t appear
dejected or angry. She would draw her own conclusions from my
behavior, seeing Karuizawa Kei as someone who didn’t care and
wouldn’t see what she wanted to talk about as anything worth
paying attention to.
I hoped that maybe, just maybe, she’d be satisfied with that
and this conversation wouldn’t keep going. I hoped that if I acted
mean, it would make her want to avoid potentially souring our
relationship, and so she wouldn’t bring the topic up after all. But
Satou-san didn’t back down.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_259">
<p>“Karuizawa-san… Why did you break up with Hirata-kun?”
she asked.
“Huh? Didn’t I already tell you the reason?”
Even though her question wasn’t directly related to the
subject of Kiyotaka, it was close enough to make my heart jump in
my chest. Even so, I managed to keep those feelings from
showing, thanks to everything I’d gone through until now.
“I mean, yeah, I’ve heard the reason, more or less. It’s just…
something about it doesn’t feel right to me.”
“Really? Y’know, I was thinkin’ it was kinda a waste, how it
went down and all. Hey, do you maybe have your sights set on
trying to become Hirata-kun’s girlfriend or something?” I asked her.
Satou-san was no longer interested in Kiyotaka. That was
what I was hoping to hear, which was why I said what I did, like I
was trying to confirm that she was now after someone else. But
Satou-san didn’t respond to that. Instead, she came back at me
with a question that felt like a surprise attack.
“I was thinking… Is it possible you broke up with Hirata-kun
because you actually had a different goal in mind?”
Oh, so she had noticed, after all. She knows that I’ve fallen
in love with Kiyotaka, and that our relationship is changing…
“What’re you talking about? I have no clue what you’re trying
to say.”
Even now, I was forcing myself into a box. Trying to force
myself to be the “normal” persona I’d created. Sooner or later, the
day would come when I had to reveal my relationship with
Kiyotaka. And when that day came, I’d have no choice but to run
away, because I had decided I needed to keep all of it secret.
No matter what Satou-san might say to me, I was
determined to, at least on the surface, smooth things completely
over.
Well, no. I supposed I should say I thought I was determined
to do so.
“…Karuizawa-san… Are you dating Ayanokouji-kun?”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_260">
<p>“Huh…?”
Because I got hit with an entirely unexpected gut punch. My
reaction was delayed, like I’d just gotten smacked from behind. If I
had been talking to any other girl, it would’ve been different. But
since I was talking to Satou-san, that delayed reaction was
basically a fatal blow. She saw right through me, as if my answer
was totally obvious.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_261">
<img src="https://cote12.ct.ws/16.jpg">
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_262">
<p>If she’d asked me if I liked him or something, I could have
handled it. But what Satou-san said went further than that.
“…So, I was right after all, huh?”
“Hey, wait, uh, no, no, why would you even think that?!” I
wailed.
I denied it, of course. Whether I actually intended to deny it
or not, I did it anyway. Because there was no way I could admit
what was going on to her right now.
“Why would you, I mean, I, uh…” I stammered.
I kept trying to deny it, but I just got lost in Satou-san’s
eyes. She looked like she was about to cry, but she looked angry,
too. That was totally fair. She’d trusted me and come to me asking
for advice on how to get Kiyotaka into a relationship. And I’d
cooperated with her, while hiding the fact that I was attracted to
him.
If I were in Satou-san’s shoes, I would’ve slapped me in the
face for going out with Kiyotaka after all of that. Even if I didn’t
come out and admit to it, I was sure it was already becoming a
certainty in Satou-san’s mind.
“Did you already have your eye on Ayanokouji-kun when I
said I wanted to get to know him better and asked you to help? Or
did you like him before then?”
“H-hey, wait, hold on a second. I…”
I had no other choice but to stand there and take everything
that Satou-san was throwing at me.
“I… I said the same thing to Matsushita-san and the others,
too. That I think that you broke up with Hirata-kun because you
like Ayanokouji-kun. But it’s not like I was just throwing that out
there randomly, you know? I’ve felt fairly sure about it… So, yeah,
that’s why I brought it up,” said Satou-san.
I had already heard Matsushita-san had some suspicions
about my relationship with Kiyotaka. I couldn’t talk my way out of
this situation anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_263">
<p>“Please tell me the truth. If you don’t, I… I don’t think I
could see you as my friend anymore, Karuizawa-san,” she added.
The intensity of her emotions could be heard in her words. If
anything, it felt like she was trying her hardest to keep being my
friend, until the very end.
“I…” I stammered.
Seeing how serious that look in her eyes was, I just couldn’t
bring myself to lie to her anymore. Where should I even start?
Well, I supposed there was no point in hiding anything. The least I
could do was apologize to Satou-san by opening up and telling her
everything.
“I’m… Ayano… Well, it’s just like you guessed, Satou-san. I’m
going out with Kiyotaka,” I told her.
Naturally, she reacted quite strongly when she heard me say
that. Even though she’d been rejected when she told him how she
felt, she still liked Kiyotaka. It was because I’d fallen for the same
person that I understood how she felt.
“So, you call him Kiyotaka, huh,” said Satou-san.
I wanted to run from her somewhat cold stare, but I
couldn’t.
“We started going out at the end of spring break. Really not
very long ago,” I replied.
“What I want to know most is when you started liking him,”
said Satou-san.
“…To tell you the truth, I’m not sure exactly when. But when
you came to me earlier, talking about how you wanted to go out
with him, I was starting to think of Kiyotaka as more than a
classmate,” I answered.
“I see…”
I didn’t think she was very satisfied with my answer.
“You’re mad at me, aren’t you?” I asked.
Satou-san had been looking me in the eye until moments
ago, but now I couldn’t seem to return the favor.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_264">
<p>“Well, I don’t exactly feel good about it. You knew how I felt,
but you went behind my back and started to get closer to
Ayanokouji-kun yourself.”
There wasn’t a single thing I could say back to her about
that.
“But still, Ayanokouji-kun did turn me down after I told him
how I felt about him, so… I’m not really in a position where I could
be mad at you. But it’s just…”
A spring breeze gently blew past us. I was startled by a
sudden, dull sound. The next moment, I realized I’d been slapped
on the left cheek.
“Okay, so I guess that means we’re square… Can we forget
all of this ever happened and go on being friends, Karuizawa-san?”
asked Satou-san.
Honestly, the fact that she had slapped me was a little
unexpected. I guessed that was just how hard to forgive my
actions were, in her mind.
“You want to give me one more shot?” I replied in a friendly
way, offering my right cheek to her.
After all, the pain she’d felt was a lot greater than what I was
dealing with right now.
“No, I don’t, I mean… I really don’t think I could do that. I’m
sorry for hitting you…” said Satou-san.
“No, I’m the one who’s sorry. I mean, falling for the same
guy as you. Satou-san, and…” I replied, trailing off.
“Hey, I don’t blame you for that. Ayanokouji-kun is really
cool, and he’s way hotter than Hirata-kun,” she replied, teasing a
little.
Without even thinking, I spread both my arms wide and
hugged Satou-san tight.
“Whoa, hey, Karuizawa-san, what are you doing?!”
“…I’m so sorry!”
“R-really, it’s okay, you don’t…”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_265">
<p>Although I felt so sorry about everything that happened, I
was overjoyed, too. I hugged her tight, unable to hold back my
emotions anymore. Falling for the same person was really tough,
but I guessed this meant that we both understood his charms.
This wasn’t a situation where we could talk about who won and
who lost. I mean, I was sure that from here on out, the number of
people who discovered Kiyotaka’s charms would only keep
increasing.
And I had to keep fighting to make sure I didn’t lose to any
of them. If I didn’t take being his girlfriend seriously, I was sure
someone would swoop in and snatch him away from me. Satou-
san might even end up being that rival for me.
“Wanna go grab a bite?” I asked her.
Satou-san, still in my arms, nodded in response to my self-
serving request.</p>

Expulsion Approaches
 
IT WAS NOW just after eight thirty in the evening on Sunday.
The day Nanase had chosen was finally here, and it was highly
likely that the discussion we would have tonight would determine
whether we could work with Class 1-D.
Well, no. We needed to make sure we could work together.
Most students outside both our classes had already found partners.
If we couldn’t come to an agreement, we might be forced into
making some rather major compromises to avoid being hit with
penalties.
It was decided that me and Horikita would handle this
discussion, with Sudou accompanying Horikita after he strongly
requested to join her. I was sure he did just want to be around
Horikita, but also that a big part of his reason for doing so was
that he was wary of Housen. Depending on how things played out,
Housen might very well raise his hand against a woman without
batting an eye. So Sudou was there to be Horikita’s bodyguard, to
protect her.
Horikita protested of course, saying she didn’t need him
there, but Sudou insisted. This time around, though, Horikita didn’t
actually give Sudou permission herself, no matter how many times
he asked. These negotiations were expected to be just that
serious, and she had decided Sudou’s presence would be a
hindrance.
However, I made her reverse her decision. The reason I gave
was that Sudou could act on my behalf, in the unlikely event
something unforeseen occurred and things got dicey. Sudou’s
abilities should be more than enough to keep the situation in
check. In the end, Horikita gave Sudou permission to accompany
her, on the condition that he absolutely not lose his temper during
the discussion and not threaten anyone.
When I went down to the dormitory lobby to meet up with
him, Sudou was already there, sitting down on the sofa, waiting.
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_267">
<p>He smiled cheerfully and happily at me.
“Yo!” he shouted.
Actually, I should make one small correction to what I said
before. It seemed like he didn’t just want to be with Horikita. He
really wanted to be with her.
“Are your studies going pretty well? For the test?” I asked.
“Course, man. Still won’t be great, but I’m thinkin’ I should
at least get two-hundred-and-fifty points this time ‘round,” said
Sudou.
If Sudou, who currently had an academic ability ranking of E,
got two hundred and fifty points or more on this text, that would
be a fantastic achievement. I was sure his rating in the OAA app
would probably jump up to somewhere around C starting next
month. Sudou wasn’t just all talk, either. He was putting in enough
effort that his claims were backed by confidence. He was arriving
at class late far, far less frequently, and demonstrating a good
attitude in class, taking his studies seriously.
“Seems like you’ve changed a lot… It’s like you enjoy
studying now or something,” I told him.
“Well, it ain’t really like I like it or anythin’. But it is pretty fun
solving problems. On top of that, when Suzune compliments me, I
feel like I get so amped up that I could just study and study all the
time.”
The prickly, snappy attitude he had when he first started
school here seemed to have calmed down. It did seem like his
tendency to quickly lose his temper wasn’t going to be so easy to
fix, but if Horikita’s presence was enough to keep him grounded,
that was good enough.
Sudou stood up and looked at the screen showing footage
from the camera inside the elevator, as if he couldn’t contain his
excitement. Then he sat back down on the sofa, fiddling with his
phone and with his hair. Shortly afterward, he stood back up again.
He kind of looked like a young man who was about to go out on
his first date.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_268">
<p>“Hey, Ayanokouji,” muttered Sudou, still looking at the
camera footage. Maybe he had realized that I had been looking at
him. “If I were to tell Suzune how I feel about her today, do you
think she’d be, well, okay with me?”
The expression on his face was visible, even as I looked at
his side profile. He looked serious. Seeing Sudou look that way,
there was no way I couldn’t give him an honest answer.
“Probably not,” I told him.
While that might have left him feeling dejected, those were
my honest thoughts, looking at it as a third party. I had thought
for sure he wouldn’t have been satisfied hearing that answer from
me, but…
“Yeah, you’re right.”
Sudou agreed with me without batting an eye, almost like he
already knew the answer himself.
“I know that Suzune ain’t the type of person to talk ’bout
stuff like love and romance and all that. But it’s not just that,
either… I mean, there’s no way she’d be attracted to me right now.
How much trouble has my cockiness made for her? How many
times? No, not just her—how many times have I made trouble for
everyone in our class?” said Sudou.
He seemed to be saying that there was no way Horikita
would date him after taking all that into account.
“And yeah, I’m really tryin’ my best now and all, sure. But I
don’t think that cancels out all the burdens I put on our class or
anythin’, of course. So over the next two years, I’m gonna work on
improvin’ my strengths, and also on fixin’ my weaknesses, little by
little. If I do all that, then I’m sure that by the time we graduate,
I’ll have been useful to our class,” said Sudou.
“I see. Yeah, you might be right about that.”
Sudou could definitely become a valuable asset to our class,
thanks to his exceptional physical abilities. I was sure he could
come to be an essential part of our team, like Yousuke and
Kushida. He’d also grown to be able to look at himself calmly and</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_269">
<p>objectively, which was precisely why a question came to mind that
I wanted to ask him.
“Hey, so what if you put in a lot of effort and become the
most admirable, exemplary person in our class…but even then,
Horikita still doesn’t look your way. What would you do then?
Would you start to hate stuff like studying?” I asked.
There was the possibility someone could fall apart when they
learned all their efforts had been for naught. That was particularly
possible in Sudou’s case, since he was putting in all this effort for
Horikita.
“Well, yeah, I’m sure I’d wanna just stop everything, y’know?
I mean, I’d probably even feel like I wanna die. Maybe I’d even
want to go out and punch somebody. But if I actually went out and
did any of that stuff, I’m sure Suzune would be real disappointed in
me. I mean, givin’ up on studying, going on a rampage? That’d be
super lame. I definitely don’t wanna do any of that, no thanks,”
said Sudou.
An excellent response. I was sure he really believed it, too.
Of course, the real truth of his words would be tested when that
situation became a reality. No matter how much you claimed you
were resolved to handle being faced with a negative outcome,
chances were good you’d feel differently once the pain actually hit.
But that being said, if he was able to say all that right now,
at this point in time, then there probably wasn’t anything for me to
worry about for the time being.
“Oh, looks like she’s here!” said Sudou.
The camera showed Horikita getting on the elevator. Sudou
must have been feeling restless or something, because he walked
away, turned his back to the elevator door, and started taking deep
breaths while stretching his arms out in an effort to calm himself
down, like he was doing warm-up calisthenics or something.
Shortly afterward, the elevator arrived at the first floor.
Sudou was still taking deep breaths.
“Sorry to have kept you waiting. What is Sudou-kun doing?”
asked Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_270">
<p>“Looks like he’s taking deep breaths,” I replied.
Horikita had a puzzled look on her face for a moment, but
she quickly went back to her usual stiff expression.
We were going to meet up in one of the karaoke rooms in
the Keyaki Mall today. On both regular weekdays and on
weekends, these were popular places for people to hang out late
into the night, since we were allowed to use those rooms until 10
p.m. Karaoke was, of course, one of the recreational facilities we
had on campus. It was often used for things like stress relief or to
chat with friends.
But at this school, it had another major purpose. The rooms
were private, which made them terrific locations to have detailed
discussions, without running the risk of being seen or heard by
others. They were the easiest places to have secret meetings on
campus without being noticed. Of course, in terms of
confidentiality alone, nothing beat the privacy of one’s personal
room in the dormitory. But you were inevitably limited to only
being able to meet certain people that way.
With the exam coming up next week, there didn’t seem to be
that many people around at this time of day. So you could say this
was the best time to meet with Housen in secret and have a
discussion.
“Hey, are you really sure we can get that cocky new kid to
help us out?” asked Sudou.
“I wouldn’t have spent so much time on this if I didn’t think
we could make a cooperative relationship work,” said Horikita.
Exactly. It was precisely because we had determined it was
possible that we were here today.
“At this current point in time, many of the gifted first-year
students have been taken by Sakayanagi-san and Ryuuen-kun.
And Ichinose-san has offered herself up, providing salvation for the
weak. The only weapons in our arsenal are points or trust,” said
Horikita.
“Guess you’re right, yeah… We ain’t gonna beat Sakayanagi
or Ryuuen in points, and we ain’t beatin’ Ichinose when it comes</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_271">
<p>to trust,” said Sudou.
“Precisely. Which is exactly why Housen-kun presents both
an opportunity and a problem for us.”
Housen wouldn’t be swayed by the appeal of Class A’s
reputation, nor by some paltry sum of Private Points. And he
wouldn’t so much as even notice Ichinose’s offer of salvation.
Which was why we, Class D, had a chance.
“So, the point is seein’ how much we can push them into
makin’ a deal with us, without havin’ to make too many
compromises on our end,” said Sudou.
“Right. The more time that passes, the more it’ll be us
second-years who start to panic. With so many students having
already found partners, we’ll be at an unavoidable disadvantage.”
If we declined the terms Housen presented us with, he’d
show no mercy. He’d simply change plans and let us end up
getting paired with people at random. He didn’t care whatsoever
about his own classmates being penalized.
I was interested to see how Horikita intended to challenge
him.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_272">
<p>7.1
 
“HEY, UH, come to think of it, ain’t the meetin’ at nine?
Aren’t we kinda early?” said Sudou.
It was still well before nine now. We had about thirty minutes
until we were scheduled to meet.
“It’s all right. I just wanted to get there ahead of time,” said
Horikita.
Sudou didn’t quite understand Horikita’s reasoning on that,
but he kept quiet, and followed along. I wondered if Horikita
wanted to come early to have time to calm herself, or because she
was wary there might be some kind of trap? While Sudou seemed
to think of our opponent as just a new kid, Horikita showed no
signs of dropping her guard. It might seem like she was being
cautious to the point of excess but considering that this was
Housen we were dealing with, I supposed you couldn’t criticize her
for being careful.
We got a slip of paper with a room number and reservation
information from the employee at the reception desk, then went
on inside.
“Could you please let Nanase-san know that we’re here?”
said Horikita.
“Got it,” I replied.
I sent Nanase a message, basically telling her that we had
already arrived. As expected, she replied saying they would arrive
at the time we had planned on.
“Let’s go ahead and order our own drinks, then,” said
Horikita.
“Shouldn’t we wait for ’em?” said Sudou.
“It’s fine.”
After each deciding what we wanted to drink, we looked at
the food menu next.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_273">
<p>“You can go ahead and order, if you’d like anything. What do
you want?” asked Horikita.
“Well, fries, I guess. Is that okay?” said Sudou.
“Sure.”
Horikita, using the landline phone installed in the room,
ordered the food and drinks that we had wanted. After we placed
our orders, Sudou seemed to be a little less tense. He picked up
the microphone.
“So, um, well, I think we got some time until we’re supposed
to meet. How about a song or two?” he said.
“I’m not going to sing,” said Horikita.
“Wait, really, you’re not?”
We had arrived at the karaoke room early, before the
meeting, and had ordered food and drinks. I supposed Sudou had
assumed the next step would be to start singing, since that was
typically how things went at a place like this. He looked
disappointed now, probably because he’d wanted to hear Horikita’s
singing voice.
“Sudou-kun. I’m warning you once again. Do not say
anything unnecessary,” said Horikita.
“I-I got it, yeah. But hey, shouldn’t you tell that to
Ayanokouji, too?”
“He doesn’t speak more than necessary. Actually, if anything,
he’s the sort of person who doesn’t speak even when he should,”
said Horikita.
Well, that was far from a compliment. She was just airing her
grievances about me. Sudou pouted, seemingly not too happy with
the answer Horikita had given him.
When it was time for our meeting, the first to arrive was
Nanase.
“Sorry to have kept you waiting,” said Nanase.
“Outta the way, Nanase,” huffed Housen Kazuomi from
behind her, forcing her to walk further inside.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_274">
<p>“Oh, you’re right on time. And here I was sure you’d be
really late,” said Horikita, suggesting she wouldn’t have been
surprised if he’d arrived late on purpose, just to irritate her. Rather
like how Miyamoto Musashi had arrived late to his duel on Ganryu-
jima.
“Hey, I’m always on time when I decide I’m gonna go
somewhere. And I don’t like folks who give me a hard time just
because I’m a little late. Anyway, looks like you got here pretty
damn early… What, did you really hate the thought of waitin’ for
me that much? Come on, don’t be so nervous,” teased Housen.
“Can you please not let your imagination get the better of
you? Don’t misunderstand. We were simply enjoying ourselves,
since we came all the way to karaoke. Understand?” said Horikita,
telling Housen that he needed to broaden his mind.
Upon the table were some partially consumed drinks, and
half-eaten food. She had staged the scene to look as though we’d
been having fun at karaoke right up until the last minute.
“Looks that way,” said Housen.
Which meant that the negotiating had already begun.
“Well, whatever. I’ll find out whether you’re bluffin’ soon
enough, when we get to talkin’,” said Housen.
He plopped down hard on the couch, as if he were some
kind of big shot, so much so that it was difficult to imagine he was
a new student. He spread his legs wide, taking up enough space
for three people all by himself.
“Okay, so? Nanase explained everythin’ to me. She said you
wanted my class to help you out,” said Housen.
My class, he said. From the sound of it, Class D was already
completely under Housen’s control, then. It had only been a couple
of weeks since school had started, but I sensed no weakness in his
statement.
“Not exactly. What I’m saying is that our two classes will
work together. No one will be above or below the other. We’ll be
on equal footing,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_275">
<p>“That so? So, you’re not bringin’ up the fact that you’re one
grade level above us then, huh. Gotta say, not patronizin’ us, that’s
a wise choice.”
Nanase quietly observed what Housen was saying and doing.
She didn’t speak up or refute any point in particular. Considering
she’d been playing the role of mediator, and the fact that she was
the sole person he’d brought here with him, we could probably be
certain Nanase was someone Housen valued. I wasn’t sure if that
was because he admired how she had the guts to say she wouldn’t
give in to Housen’s threats of violence, or if there was something
else. In any case, there was a way for us to cut right through and
force Nanase over to our side.
“I understand there are still a certain number of students in
your grade who don’t feel an intense sense of commitment to their
peers, and wouldn’t think anything of it if their classmates got in
trouble. However, you should begin to understand how things are
after seeing us. There will most certainly come a time in the future
when you will need the help of your classmates,” said Horikita.
“So…you’re sayin’ we gotta together to get through school
without anyone gettin’ kicked out, huh?” said Housen.
“If you really do have so much authority over your class that
you view it as your private property, that’s actually rather
convenient to this arrangement. With just one command, a
substantial number of your classmates will follow, right?” said
Horikita.
Housen brought his left pinky up, stuck it inside his left ear
and started twisting it around a bit. Then he removed his finger
and held it up, pointed it at Horikita, and blew off what was on it
in her direction. Sudou’s face tensed up, but he remembered
Horikita’s warning, and kept himself in check. His clenched fists
were shaking as he held them down on his lap.
Horikita simply endured Housen’s openly vulgar conduct,
without turning away. “Can you please stop?”
“Okay, so, in the first place,” said Housen.
It seemed what she’d said just went in one ear and out the
other, because he started speaking as though he were talking to</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_276">
<p>himself.
“It’s fair to say that you’re the leader of Class 2-D, right?”
said Housen. He was now rewinding to check for weaknesses in
the very premise of this discussion.
“You could interpret it that way,” replied Horikita.
“I don’t think there’s anything strange about Horikita-senpai
being the leader, considering her abilities,” said Nanase, addressing
Housen. That was the first time she had opened her mouth during
this entire conversation.
“All right, then, I’ll give the leader here a warning. I sure as
hell ain’t planning on working with you under this so-called ‘equal
footing’ garbage or whatever,” said Housen.
It seemed he wasn’t going to make things that easy, after all.
I supposed there was no avoiding the disparity between us. We
wanted to protect our classmates no matter what, whereas Housen
didn’t really care one way or another about tossing his to the
wolves. The relative severity of the penalties we faced were also
worlds apart, with us facing expulsion and them losing out on
three months’ worth of Private Points.
“That sounds about right. You are that kind of person, I
suppose,” said Horikita.
“If you know that already, then out with it. Stop being such a
penny pincher. I’ll hear you out if you’ve got a good offer for me,”
said Housen.
“You’ll hear me out? What exactly are you expecting? Do you
seriously think we’re going to pay you to get you to help us?”
Even though we were in a disadvantageous position, Horikita
didn’t budge an inch nor make any compromises.
“Yeah, you’ll pay. You will. Because hell, you can’t really not
pay, can you? Nanase, water,” barked Housen, ordering Nanase
around while he looked over the karaoke menu.
Nanase nodded, picked up the phone, and ordered some
water from the reception desk.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_277">
<p>“I realize that I’m repeating myself here, but our proposal is
one of equal partnership. In any case, we’re absolutely not going
to hand over money, goods, or any other form of compensation to
you in return for this,” said Horikita.
“In that case, guess that means I’ll be headin’ on back
without gettin’ my drink of water then, huh?” said Housen.
Without any hesitation at all, he slapped his thighs once,
indicating to us that he was leaving.
“Please wait, Housen-kun. I think we really ought to hear
what Horikita-senpai has to say.” Nanase, who was still standing
next to Housen and listening in on the conversation, stopped him.
“Hear what she has to say? Yeah, ain’t no need,” said
Housen.
“No, we do need to. At this rate, our class will never be able
to come together as one,” said Nanase.
Horikita examined Housen and Nanase as they had their brief
exchange of words, not moving.
“Yeah, and who cares? Anyone who can’t follow orders might
as well be tossed out with the trash. I ain’t exactly gonna shed a
tear if we get rid of the wimps,” said Housen.
“That is not okay,” said Nanase.
“Nanase. You a total moron or somethin’?” replied Housen,
letting out a deep sigh. He sounded more exasperated than angry.
“There just ain’t any advantage to us acceptin’ their terms
outright.”
“I understand what you’re trying to say, Housen-kun. It is
certainly true that Horikita-senpai and her friends are desperate to
protect their classmates, and I’m sure they have good reasons for
doing so. If we don’t offer them a helping hand, students will be in
danger of being expelled. Even if they’re putting up a strong front
right now, eventually, they’ll have to make some concessions.
That’s what you’re waiting for, isn’t it?” said Nanase.
It didn’t sound at all like Nanase had interrupted the
conversation because she didn’t know what Housen was doing.
She knew.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_278">
<p>Then, she continued speaking. “I don’t think your strategy is
a bad one, Housen-kun. While the other classes looked for
partners, you deliberately chose not to make a move, deciding to
forego the early initial negotiations. All to put yourself in a more
advantageous position, to give yourself more bargaining power.”
As the deadline loomed closer and closer, the more impatient
the second-year students would become. Even students who
normally wouldn’t be worth paying for would come to be valuable.
“If you get what I’m doin’ here, then how about you try
explainin’ to me the advantage of throwin’ Horikita a bone? What’s
in it for me?” said Housen.
“That would be a relationship built on trust,” said Nanase.
She looked over at Horikita, who nodded back to her in
response.
“Come on, don’t make me laugh. A relationship built on
trust? That’s useless bullshit. Just flowery words.”
“Are you really sure about that?” Nanase directly rebutted
Housen’s response to the idea of a relationship built on trust. “It’s
certainly true that we may not need to make many concessions
ourselves in this special exam. However, we cannot be sure the
same will hold true in the future. If you make all the second-year
students your enemies, Housen-kun, you may end up in the
unfortunate situation of not being able to find a partner yourself,
no matter how many points you have. And while you might be fine
if the only penalty was points, what do you think would happen if
the person you were partnered up with intentionally scored poorly?
Expulsion would be unavoidable.”
“Hah. You seriously think there’s somebody out there who’d
go that far to take me out?” said Housen.
“You know, I’ve heard this school apparently has something
called Protection Points,” said Nanase.
She looked away from Horikita and shifted her gaze towards
Housen for the first time that evening. She’d brought up the very
thing that I had mentioned to her back in the library during our</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_279">
<p>conversation on Friday. Although Horikita was a little surprised, she
quickly grasped what was going on, and nodded.
“Yes, that’s right. They’re a unique kind of point that can
cancel out an expulsion, just one time,” she said.
Judging from the look on Housen’s face, there was no doubt
this was the first time he’d heard of it.
“It’s no wonder you don’t know about them, since you only
just enrolled. Which is why you should really make a point of
remembering them. When a test similar to this comes up in the
future, if the person you’re partnered with happens to have a
Protection Point, then… Well, depending on how things play out,
you could most definitely, unavoidably, be expelled,” said Horikita.
The more enemies you made, the more likely that scenario
would become. And the more someone hated Housen, the more
forceful they would become in their attempts to get Housen
expelled.
“Which is precisely why I think we need to work on building
a relationship based on trust, starting now,” said Nanase.
“I see. Looks like you came prepared to try and boss me
around with this stupid bullshit, huh?” said Housen.
“I am a first-year student. So naturally, my top priority is
Class 1-D. And because I recognize that you are a necessary
component of our class, Housen-kun, I don’t want to see you
make the error of looking only at the short term,” said Nanase.
Horikita had made sure she had the measure of Housen
before she set her sights on Nanase. Then, after getting Nanase to
cooperate with her in splendid fashion, they delivered a blow to
Housen. We’d been in a tough situation, but things were starting
to turn around for us.
All that remained was to see how Housen would respond,
now that he understood. Namely, to see if he’d still try to wring
some compensation out of us, resolved to face whatever
consequences it might spell for him later.
“Sounds like you really racked your brains on this one, whoo
boy. But, sorry to say… I still ain’t planning on any kind of equal</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_280">
<p>partnership,” said Housen.
Nanase and Horikita had laid out our argument to get him to
say yes. But Housen shook his head and declined without even
pretending to give it any thought.
“Hey, Housen! Dude, are you seriously ready to just go
ahead and make enemies out of all us—”
Sudou was just about to lash out, but Horikita held out her
arm, stopping him.
“He hasn’t left the negotiating table yet,” she said.
“Yeah, she’s right. Don’t go jumpin’ to conclusions now,” said
Housen, replying to Sudou. He remained planted firmly in his seat,
cocksure and bullheaded as ever, making no pretense of leaving.
“But what do you intend to do, then? We aren’t going to
change our stance. We’re asking for an equal partnership,” said
Horikita.
“Yeah, I’ve seen enough to know that. I’ll give you credit,
you got guts, lady.” Housen clapped his hands five times,
apparently in a show of admiration of Horikita’s tireless efforts.
“But that bein’ said, this whole equal footing thing… I can’t really
believe it’s all that equal.”
“So if we can offer you proof that it is, you’ll work with us?”
said Horikita.
“Well, somethin’ like that, maybe,” said Housen.
“I’m afraid that doesn’t quite add up. We would both be
operating under the same conditions. What reason do you have to
feel that it wouldn’t be equal?” said Horikita.
“You’re sayin’ all this stuff about a relationship built on trust,
but trust goes both ways, don’t it? That don’t mean I should just
be grateful and take whatever you’re dishin’ out. The fact that
you’re suggestin’ that our class could be in a similar situation next
year? That we could be in trouble? Yeah, that’s somethin’ I should
be so grateful for, honey. I’m tearin’ up over here. But that’s just a
self-serving prediction for your benefit. It ain’t an absolute
certainty of somethin’ to come in the future,” said Housen.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_281">
<p>Housen certainly had a point. Horikita’s proposal was built on
the fundamental premise that we would be supporting one
another. However, our class was the one that was looking for help
right now. The idea was that in exchange for their help, when the
time came that they needed something, we’d help them out. In
that sense, it was like an insurance policy, so to speak. And there
was a good chance they’d never actually have to use it.
“I suppose. Well, if you’re going to go that route, why don’t
you tell me what you’d like, then? Just for reference,” said Horikita.
“Hand over a million Private Points to me as collateral. Then,
if we ever are in trouble and come to you guys for help, I’ll gladly
pay you back in full,” said Housen.
That was actually a fairly reasonable sum, considering the
number of points we’d spend dealing with other classes. However,
if his class never actually used the insurance policy, that meant
we’d basically be handing over a million points for nothing. In
short, that meant all those points would end up in Housen’s
pocket.
“I mean, if this whole relationship built on trust or whatever
is going to be so important in the future, like you say it is, then
that ain’t too steep a price, no?” said Housen.
But if his class really did come seeking our help sometime,
we’d get the million points back.
“If ya need, I can put it in writing. How ’bout it?” said
Housen.
If we put the agreement in writing, the legitimacy of the deal
would be recognized by the school, who could enforce it. But this
was all built on the premise that Housen would come looking for
our help eventually. It was possible Housen might invoke the
agreement if he were in danger of being expelled himself, but I
doubted he’d give up those points to help out his classmates.
Which made this more dangerous than handing over points and
signing contracts on an individual basis.
Housen had hit us with a good counter. Apparently, simply
being good in a fight wasn’t the only thing he could boast about.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_282">
<p>He was a skilled negotiator, a formidable foe who could be quite
conniving, just like Ryuuen.
“It’s true that what you’re saying isn’t entirely unreasonable.
However, I cannot accept your terms,” said Horikita.
“I see, I see. Well, that’s too bad. Here I gave you a nice,
easy way for us to resolve all these issues, and you go back to
playing hardball,” said Housen.
“It seems that way.”
Apparently, Horikita had no intention of giving in and
agreeing to a cooperative relationship if that meant letting Housen
reap all the rewards himself. But that meant that we’d end up
having partners decided at random, which, in turn, meant we’d
have to do our best to mitigate risk by getting our poorer students
partnered with the other classes, even if that meant throwing
money at the problem.
Housen let out a short laugh.
“Ha!”
He leaned forward on the sofa, moving from his seated
position for the first time since he sat down. Then, he reached his
large arm out and grabbed Horikita by the collar of her shirt. The
first to react to this was Sudou, who had been standing watch
right beside Horikita. He grabbed Housen’s thick arm forcefully and
give him an intense glare.
“Hey… Don’t you think about layin’ a hand on a girl,” snarled
Sudou.
“Oh ho. What, now it’s the idiot’s turn, huh?” said Housen.
“Calm down, Sudou-kun,” said Horikita.
“But…!”
“It’s all right. The negotiations aren’t over yet.”
It might have appeared like negotiations had broken down,
but it was also true that the words “I’m done negotiating” hadn’t
actually passed Housen’s lips yet.
“Man, you got a confident look in your eye. Do you seriously
think I won’t raise a hand against a chick? Or do you think that</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_283">
<p>you can beat me, by using your social standin’ as a woman or
somethin’?” said Housen.
“To think that someone would actually talk that way in this
day and age, my goodness. Why don’t you try to rein in that
misogyny a little?” said Horikita.
“Well then, how’s about I give you a better option. If you can
really work me over in a fight and get me to say uncle, I’ll agree to
your offer for an equal partnership, no strings attached. Whaddya
say?” replied Housen, making a rather ridiculous proposal.
“’Kay, then. In that case, I’ll step up and fight you. You ain’t
got a problem with that, do ya?” said Sudou.
“Hell, sure, Sudou can fight me. Even that weirdo Ayanokouji
over there, lookin’ at me with this blank face and all—he can, too.
Or even you, Horikita. I’d welcome fightin’ you with open arms,”
said Housen. “Actually, if you want, I’ll take on all three of ya at
once.”
“Sounds good to me, Horikita. If I win, we’ll get that contract
made… And besides, I’m already sick to my stomach dealin’ with
this guy.” Sudou was clearly reaching the limit of his patience with
Housen, who still had his hands on Horikita’s collar and hadn’t let
her go.
“Determining whether or not we enter into a cooperative
relationship based on a fight? That’s completely absurd. Even if
that was the only bargaining chip we had in this negotiation, we
still shouldn’t take it,” said Horikita.
“Why not though? I mean, if this Housen guy says he’s fine
with it, then there ain’t no problem,” said Sudou.
Horikita ignored Sudou, and then quietly spoke her mind,
telling us her thoughts on the matter.
“I really thought you’d be a little smarter than this, Housen-
kun. That time you first showed your face on our floor, I picked up
your intentions from what you said. You said you were willing to
join forces with our class, and I agreed with that sentiment. I
thought it would be wonderful if we could work together, forming a
partnership, class to class,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_284">
<p>“Well, yeah, guess I might have said somethin’ like that,” he
replied.
“But… That was just a misunderstanding on my part. You
weren’t actually thinking anything of the sort at all,” said Horikita.
She briefly closed her eyes and let out a deep breath, before
continuing, “These negotiations are over.”
It wasn’t Housen who signaled the end of these talks, but
rather Horikita herself. Up until this point, Housen had seemed to
be enjoying himself quite a bit, but the moment Horikita said we
were finished, anger flashed across his face. He let go of his grip
on Horikita’s collar. Seeing that, Sudou went to sit back down,
holding in his anger.
And in that next moment…
Splash! Water flew across the room. Housen had picked up a
cup in his large hand and splashed its contents right in Horikita’s
face.
Horikita could never have predicted this happening. Before
she could even utter a single word, Sudou lunged at Housen,
almost jumping over the table.
“Son of a bitch!” snarled Sudou.
He’d already been pushed to his limits, desperately trying to
keep his feelings in check. But when Horikita got splashed with
water, that completely overrode any rationality he possessed. It
seemed Housen was going to carry on behaving the way he always
did, making fun of other people right to the very end. No one
could blame Sudou for getting angry after seeing the girl he liked
be humiliated.
“Stop!”
It was none other than Horikita who stopped Sudou in his
tracks, the instant after he bellowed loudly with rage. If she had
been even a single second later, Sudou’s fist would have collided
with Housen’s cheek.
“Sudou-kun… Don’t thoughtlessly play into his hands,” said
Horikita.
“Yeah, I know, but still!” he shouted.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_285">
<p>Horikita looked at Housen, not even bothering to dry her wet
hair. “If you’re upset about the fact that negotiations have broken
down, then perhaps you should have conducted yourself a little
better.”
She’d wanted to establish a cooperative relationship with
Housen, no matter the cost, for the sake of our class. Had she
determined pressing the matter any further was ultimately not
worth it, then?
Housen kept his eyes locked on Horikita, but she looked
away, as if to say that she had seen enough.
“Let’s go,” she said.
“A-are you sure?” Though clearly frustrated, Sudou asked to
make sure.
“Are you really okay with this, Housen-kun?” asked Nanase,
checking with Housen at almost the exact same time that Sudou
asked his question.
“Huh?” replied Housen.
“I think we should have agreed to work with Horikita-senpai,”
said Nanase.
“Ha! Hey, they’re the ones who walked away from the
negotiatin’ table. I ain’t gonna meet them halfway,” said Housen.
Housen and Nanase didn’t protest Horikita bringing the
negotiations to a close, but accepted that we would be going our
separate ways.
I shot a sidelong glance at Horikita to see how she was
doing. The fact that our negotiations had failed was a great
setback, but from what I could tell of Horikita’s expression from
her side profile, she didn’t seem disappointed yet. If anything, she
looked like she wasn’t done. Like we were still in the middle of
negotiations.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_286">
<p>7.2
 
THE THREE OF US left the karaoke place after Horikita took
care of the bill. It seemed that would be the end of it, but Housen
and Nanase followed us. Sudou turned back to glare at them
menacingly from time to time, but since we had to take the same
route back to the dorms, it wasn’t like we could really complain
about it.
Perhaps because he understood the situation now, Housen
called out to us in a somewhat odd fashion. “Hang on.”
“There’s no reason for us to wait. We’re already finished
talking.”
Horikita gave him the cold shoulder. But Housen showed no
sign of backing down. Apparently, Horikita’s all-or-nothing gamble
had turned out to be a good move.
“Okay, it’s just like you said, Horikita. That day, I went out to
meet your class. ’Cause I knew right away that at this school, Class
D is the bottom of the barrel, the lowest of the low. And rather
than let the other classes treat us like a joke, the quickest way to
deal with ’em would be for us to work together, Class D to Class
D,” said Housen.
He’d sent us a signal back then, just as Horikita had
interpreted. However, whether he wanted to form the same kind of
equal, cooperative partnership that was thinking of was an entirely
different question.
“So?” said Horikita.
“So? Whaddya mean, so? Come on. What, you really okay
with just lettin’ negotiations fall apart? You and I are alike, y’know.
We’re leaders who thought up the same kinda thing. You get me?”
said Housen.
“As you intend to keep making ridiculous demands, nothing
is going to change,” said Horikita.
“So, you’re plannin’ on goin’ into this special exam as is,
then? Leave things as they are, get partnered up at random, and</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_287">
<p>get hit with the penalty?”
“That’s right. We are prepared to be penalized, if necessary,”
said Horikita.
It would be painful, for sure, but it wasn’t like this test was
insurmountable. Thanks to the efforts of Kushida and some other
people, we’d already started to secure the safety of the students in
our class who were near E-rank and D-rank in academic ability.
“All right, I gotcha. In that case, how about this idea?”
Though Horikita had said nothing about restarting
negotiations, House just carried on by himself.
“I’ll order everybody in my class to team up with ya. And
you’ll hand over your points. Two million,” said Housen.
That was far from a compromise. He’d reopened negotiations
in aggressive fashion, demanding an even higher number of points
than before.
“Two million? Well, I suppose you’ve shown your true colors
now,” said Horikita.
“Yeah, yeah, you can say whatever you want. But it’s the
only way you guys can be sure to avoid gettin’ expelled. Most of
the people in other classes have already settled on their partners
and all. Come on, there ain’t nothin’ for you to gain by being a
tightwad who won’t pay up. Or maybe you wanna be crushed by
yours truly?” said Housen.
At this point, we had arrived at the junction where the path
branched off in two separate directions for the first-year and
second-year dormitories.
Horikita stopped and turned around to respond to Housen’s
question.
“Crushed? And how exactly do you plan to do that? You can’t
intentionally score poorly on the test because of the rules, so you
can’t get us expelled that way. Rules that you must follow, by the
way. You don’t exactly have the courage to break those rules, do
you? In that case, all we have to do is make sure teams get at
least five hundred and one points, no matter the combination of
students,” said Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_288">
<p>“Yeah, I ain’t gonna do it in such a roundabout way. I’ll crush
you with this,” said Housen, brandishing his fist with a menacing
smile.
“Control through violence… I suppose there really are people
everywhere who think like you do,” said Horikita.
“I don’t care if you don’t like it. This is how I do things,” said
Housen.
“I suppose so. In that case, it seems we may never be able
to understand each other.”
Horikita started walking once more. Even at the very end—at
the last possible minute—she wasn’t giving in. Or rather, I
supposed I should say, Housen was the kind of opponent she
couldn’t give in to. Because if she did, we’d never get the
partnership she wanted.
“Hold it.”
“What is it now?” asked Horikita.
“I got it. I’ll keep what you just said in mind.” At the last
minute, Housen said something we hadn’t expected.
“What are you talking about?” asked Horikita.
“I mean, it’s only natural that you’ll try holdin’ onto the
advantage in a negotiation as long as you possibly can, right?” He
was basically admitting that he’d been trying to get Horikita to give
in and compromise.
“In that case, are you saying that you’re agreeing to a
completely equal partnership?” said Horikita.
“Think of it more like our little chat’s about to go into
overtime. Anyway, there’s a chance people might spot us talkin’
here. Let’s have ourselves a change of venue,” said Housen.
It was almost ten at night on a Sunday now. Most students
should have gone back to their dorm rooms, but even so, I
supposed there was no escaping the fact that if someone did
happen to come by, they’d be able to hear our conversation.
“Even so, we can’t exactly take this inside the dorms,” replied
Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_289">
<p>In consideration of curfew, there were probably no suitable
meeting places left for us tonight. But with time running out for
both groups right now, this was a problem we didn’t want to put
off any longer.
“Anywhere’s fine. Back at the dorms, anywhere, wherever. If
we just have a little time, we can talk things out,” said Housen.
He looked so completely confident that Horikita wasn’t going
to turn him down. She’d been hoping he would come chasing after
her, even though she gave him the cold shoulder earlier.
“…Very well. You have ten minutes,” said Horikita.
“C’mon, over here,” said Housen.
He led us over to the dormitory building used by the third-
year students last year, which was now being used by the first-
years. We went around to the back of the building, a remarkably
dark and quiet place that was used for no other purpose other
than disposing of trash. It was unlikely anyone would see us here.
“All right, let’s continue where we left off, then. The terms
we’ve set haven’t changed. Is that clear?” said Horikita.
“Yeah, let’s see…”
Housen, after appearing lost in thought for a minute, briefly
folded his arms. Then he immediately uncrossed them and held up
the index, middle, and ring fingers on his right hand.
“Three million. You guys pay me, and I’ll save all those
friggin’ idiots you got right now,” said Housen.
After hearing his suggestion, everyone present, myself
included, could only respond with stunned silence.
“What are you talking about?” said Horikita.
Was this what it was like to feel completely exasperated?
Even Horikita couldn’t help but let out a couple of sighs. We were
supposed to be getting the negotiations back on track after they
broke down earlier. But now Housen was asking for even more
points than before. This defied all logic.
“What, don’t you get it? I said I’ll work with ya for three
million,” said Housen.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_290">
<p>“Dude, stop screwin’ with us. We already told ya before that
we ain’t handin’ over a single point!” shouted Sudou.
“I ain’t screwin’ with anybody. I mean, I gave you another
opportunity to negotiate with me, didn’t I?” He spoke as though he
were the one who’d set up everything about these negotiations.
“It would appear…I made an error in judgment in deciding to
listen to you,” said Horikita.
The chance that Housen would make a reasonable decision
had been a faint ray of hope for Horikita. But in the end, her wish
wasn’t granted.
“Wait. You really think ya can just leave?” snarled Housen.
He smacked his fist lightly against the wall, putting on a
threatening display.
“What? You think that because we’re in a secluded location,
you can solve things with violence? Your usual go-to?” said
Horikita.
“At the very least, I can beat you half to death. How ’bout
that?” said Housen.
“Go ahead, do whatever you please,” said Horikita.
She shook her head and moved to leave, probably because
she didn’t think Housen would actually resort to getting physical.
But Nanase, who had been standing next to him, turned her face
away slightly, almost as if she anticipated what was about to
happen next.
Housen moved.
“Suzune!!” shouted Sudou frantically, rushing over to Horikita
and pulling her out of the way.
Housen’s foot whipped by the very spot Horikita had been
standing in just moments ago. And then, suddenly, his gigantic
form barreled down on her.
“Wait, wha—!”
Horikita realized Housen was seriously trying to hurt her, but
she still couldn’t get her body out of the way. Sudou stepped in to
protect her, catching Housen’s repeated blows.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_291">
<p>“Grh!”
“Ha ha! C’mon, show me how much you can take!” shouted
Housen.
“Fine by me! Bring it, chump! Any jerk who raises a hand
against Suzune will get no mercy from me!” shouted Sudou.
Housen, laughing like he was having the time of his life,
launched an attack on Sudou. And Sudou, already well past the
limits of his patience, responded in kind.
“Wh-what are you thinking…?!” shouted Horikita.
It wasn’t surprising she was so upset about the fight that
had just suddenly broken out in earnest. No matter how
unmonitored this place might be, it would definitely be a problem if
we were found. Forget suspension—we could very well be
expelled.
“Horikita-senpai, perhaps the circumstances at this school
have changed a little from how they were before?” said Nanase,
watching this incomprehensible turn of events with a cold look on
her face. “Similar to how you are intimately familiar with how
things were last year, we new students understand the current
situation better than you do.”
“What do you mean…?” asked Horikita.
“A few representatives of the first-years were summoned to
the student council room by Student Council President Nagumo,
who explained the state of things to us in person. He told us that
starting this year, this school was going to be more meritocratic.
And therefore, the students would be given a greater degree of
freedom,” said Nanase.
“Are you saying fighting is one of those freedoms?” said
Horikita.
“That’s not what I’m saying. However, as far as Housen-kun
was able to confirm, a certain amount of fighting between
students is considered inevitable. And President Nagumo has
promised he won’t be as harsh in his judgment as he was last
year,” said Nanase.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_292">
<p>Unlike Horikita’s older brother, Manabu, Nagumo had a much
more permissive mindset when it came to fighting. The student
council acted to mediate disputes between students, so if it was
true they intended to allow a certain degree of fighting, this
incident was much less likely to cause trouble.
While Horikita and Nanase talked, the match between
Housen and Sudou was quickly coming to a head, with the victor
starting to become clear.
“Orah!”
Even though Sudou had been blessed with an impressive
physique, Housen managed to shove him against the wall with
more force than Sudou could muster. He then grabbed Sudou by
the collar with both hands, raising him high enough into the air
that Sudou’s legs no longer touched the ground.
“H-hey!”
Even though he was on the ropes, Sudou tried desperately to
fight back. But suspended in the air, all he could do was defend
himself, not attack. Housen was exerting so much pressure on him,
it was almost like he was trying to force him physically into the
wall.
“Ngh! Y-you ass!” shouted Sudou.
He grabbed both of Housen’s arms, and despite being held in
place with a limited range of movement, struck Housen with his
knee. Housen staggered slightly, and Sudou managed to break free
of his grip. But immediately afterward, Housen hit him with a
repeated series of kicks. While Sudou didn’t flinch, the force of the
blows slammed him back into the wall.
Before the fight broke out, they’d seemed a match for one
another. But now that they’d really gotten going, the difference
was considerable. Sudou made enemies rather easily and had
probably been in quite a few fights himself. Thanks to his
athleticism and his physique, which had been honed through
playing basketball, almost no one had been a match for him in his
life.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_293">
<p>However, Housen was in a different league. He’d probably
been in many, many more fights than Sudou. A countless number
of them, in fact. And he’d probably survived some extremely
violent, dangerous situations. The difference in their experience
was obvious.
Additionally, his arms were so strong and thick that it was
hard to believe he and Sudou were only a year apart. And yet,
despite his size, his movements were quick and nimble,
demonstrating a kind of innate agility.
There was a reason that even Ryuuen, of all people, had
stopped himself from fighting Housen. Namely, he knew that
Housen wasn’t the kind of opponent you could beat in a straight
hand-to-hand fight.
Even so, Sudou wouldn’t go down so easily. He was one of
the strongest students in the entire school—head and shoulders
above most of the rest. But that only meant he would end up
taking Housen’s blows for a much, much longer time.
Housen continued to whale on him, barraging him with blows
from left and right. Much as Sudou wanted to break through and
find an opening, the best he could do was simply take Housen’s
furious punches. If he tried to counter in any way, his guard would
be broken in an instant, and Housen would put him down.
“No one stands to gain from this!” shouted Horikita.
Her words didn’t reach Housen. At this point, it was
impossible to stop Housen with words alone.
However, they did reach Sudou’s ears. Though for only a
brief instant, Sudou glanced at Horikita. Hearing the voice of the
girl he had to protect somehow lit a great fire within him.
“Oraaaah!”
Sudou tackled Housen with the determination of someone
ready to put his life on the line, pushing him away from the wall
and trying to force him to the ground.
“Oh ho, you wanna do a test of pure strength, huh?” said
Housen.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_294">
<p>He caught Sudou’s large frame, smiling, latched onto him
and lifted him into the air again.
“Wh-whoa?!”
Housen flipped Sudou around so he was now up against the
wall. He pushed him away, and then taunted him, beckoning him
to come over with his left hand.
“Oh, poor baby, was it hard being all cramped up against the
wall? Hey, that’s just the right kinda handicap for me, though.
Bring it.”
“I’ve had enough of you!” howled Sudou, his engines now
running at full throttle.
He was about to launch another all-out attack against
Housen, when—
“Hey, Sudou, check out Horikita over there. Man, she’s glarin’
at you something fierce, dude, she’s pissed. Dontcha think?” said
Housen, unclenching his fists and pointing a finger at Horikita,
behind Sudou.
In the middle of their fight, Housen had done something that
left him completely defenseless. Sudou realized he had completely
lost his temper and gotten himself into a full-on brawl. In a panic,
he looked away from the powerful foe in front of him and back at
Horikita.
Of course, Horikita wasn’t thrilled about Sudou getting in a
fight. But she wasn’t glaring at him, either. Her expression was one
of worry, agonizing over what she should do, unable to do
anything but shout at them to stop.
The moment that Sudou turned to look back at Horikita, he
was distracted. He left himself open. By the time he realized what
had happened, it was already too late. Housen, a wicked grin on
his face, landed a furious blow on Sudou’s cheek while Sudou was
still looking the other way. A hard blow that took him completely
by surprise.
Even though Sudou was most certainly a strong fighter who
could take a lot of punishment, the smack he’d just taken was
probably the most painful thing he’d ever experienced. If he’d</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_295">
<p>been an ordinary student with an ordinary neck, it might have
been more than just painful—it could’ve seriously hurt him.
Sudou’s large body was sent flying backward. He skidded
along the ground, unable to catch himself.
“Nghh…?!”
He let out an almost inaudible groan, all but passing out in
agony from the pain. Housen, who had controlled the whole fight
so far without using any dirty tricks, had deliberately lured Sudou
into a simple trap. To hurt him not just physically but mentally as
well.
Although Sudou didn’t seem to have lost consciousness, he
was writhing in agony on the ground. I found myself wondering
again what kind of person Housen Kazuomi was. I wondered what
Housen was thinking about, what was going through his mind,
what had brought him to the negotiating table today.
It was true—just as Horikita had said before—that it had
sounded like he wanted something from our class back when we
first met. And as Housen himself had admitted earlier, he’d thought
it would be useful to team up with another Class D. Until this point,
he had just been using his superior position as a bargaining chip in
our talks, and there wasn’t anything particularly wrong with that.
However, once he saw how hard a line Horikita was taking, he
realized that trying to keep pressuring us was going to be difficult.
He realized that if he continued to be this pushy in our
negotiations, Horikita would just give up on the idea of working
together. But even so, instead of trying to compromise and meet
us halfway, he just grew even more aggressive, violent and
belligerent. He threw water in a woman’s face and was still
seriously attacking Sudou, right now.
How could he be so violent and aggressive when he risked
being suspended or expelled? That was what I’d been thinking
about all this time. Did Housen really think he could turn the tides
in his favor by sheer force? No, I couldn’t imagine someone like
him would be that foolish. In that case, what was he looking for?
What exactly was Housen hoping to gain from this fight?</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_296">
<p>“Well, all right, all right. Your faithful bodyguard is eating
dirt. Who’s next?” said Housen.
He drew closer, taking turns looking at Horikita and me. Even
though he had just finished fighting with Sudou, he didn’t even
seem out of breath.
“Do you think we… Do you think we will submit to your acts
of violence?” asked Horikita.
“I’ll just keep pounding you into the ground. Maybe even
make you sign a binding pledge or two while you’re cryin’ your
eyes out. And if you refuse to do any of that, then I’ll just keep
comin’ after you relentlessly, till I drive you to your death,” said
Housen.
No matter how tolerant they claimed the student council
intended to be of fighting, there would be consequences if this
went too far. Besides, if Housen forced Horikita to sign something
under these circumstances, there was no way it could actually hold
up as legitimate. Horikita could pretend to obey his command and
play along to defuse the situation, but I didn’t think she would do
that. Because she simply couldn’t give in to Housen’s way of doing
things.
“…Very well. I’ll stop you,” said Horikita.
She steeled herself and took up a fighting stance.
“Hoo boy, now ain’t this somethin’. Well, now, if you wanna
do this, then I’m more than happy to take you on,” said Housen.
Housen probably wasn’t expecting Horikita to have any kind
of martial arts experience. However, he wasn’t the kind of
opponent who’d fall for cheap tricks. That was something Horikita
still didn’t understand.
Suddenly, without warning, Housen thrust out his large arm.
Horikita nimbly dodged and launched an attack of her own, aiming
straight for Housen’s chin. She was hoping to settle things with
one sudden, decisive knockout right out of the gate.
“Oh ho?”
However, Housen caught hold of Horikita’s delicate fist with
almost alarming ease.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_297">
<p>“Hey, now, that was a pretty good move, lady. But too bad.”
He took a wide swing, repeatedly slapping Horikita across
the face. Horikita tried to defend herself or dodge the attacks, of
course, but in the face of Housen’s overwhelming speed, there was
nothing she could do but take the hits. She was sent flying
backward, almost as if she’d been punched with a closed fist
instead, and tumbled along the ground but then caught herself.
“S-Suzune!” shouted Sudou, gritting his teeth, trying to stand
back up. But his legs just wouldn’t cooperate, and he couldn’t do
it.
“Hey, Horikita. Sign the contract,” Housen threatened
Horikita, who had collapsed on the ground and was looking up at
him while struggling through the pain. “Five million. Five million,
and everything will be all right. Okay?”
The price had skyrocketed. It had jumped so high as to be
impossible to pay.
“Y-you must be joking… Ayanokouji-kun, call… call the
teachers…” said Horikita.
At this point, adult intervention was probably the only way
this situation could be contained. Alternatively, if a crowd
gathered, even Housen would have no choice but to stop.
“Pft, so after figurin’ out you’re no match for me, you go and
say that…? Well, whatever. You sure you wanna go that route?
Even if not all of you tried to take me on, fact is, some of you
threw punches back, didn’t you? What about that? You sure you
wanna get suspended right alongside me?” said Housen.
Even if we appealed to the school and tried to make the case
that we were justified in fighting back, it was inevitable we’d also
come under fire. Nevertheless, if we wanted to avoid any further
tragedy, we really should get a third party to intervene.
“You asshole!” shouted Sudou.
“Stay down!”
Sudou had managed to get back up and launched himself at
Housen once again. But Housen took him down with a merciless
kick, and then he finally set his sights on me.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_298">
<p>“How long are you just gonna stand there and watch, huh?”
he said.
“R-run… Ayanokouji…kun…”
“Run? Yeah, don’t do that. If you run away, Horikita and
Sudou’s injuries are about to get way, way worse,” said Housen.
Even now, I kept thinking. What did Housen want to do here
exactly? Was he really going to try using violence to advance a
demand that was never going to be met? No. That was just
illogical.
“Horikita. I’ll give ya one last chance.”
“…Last?”
“Submit to me right here and now, and fork over your points.
Do that, and…I won’t kill Ayanokouji.”
As Housen said that, he put his hand into his pocket and
took something out. For a moment, I couldn’t tell what it was
because of the cover of darkness. But when he removed what was
covering it and revealed the pointed edge, I saw something
shining silver.
“Y-you’ve…!”
“C’mon, you got eyes, you can tell what this is. It’s a knife,
man. A knife. And a real one, no doubt,” said Housen.
From the way it shone, it was clearly different from the
retractable knife toys you saw used as party props.
“You say no to my offer, and I’ll stab Ayanokouji with this,”
said Housen.
“Stop this nonsense!” shouted Horikita.
“What nonsense? Nothing nonsense ’bout it. If I can get
points out of it, I’ll gladly go this far. You get me?”
He slowly approached me, holding the knife in his right hand.
“After all this, though, I still don’t get it. What makes you so
special?” he said, looking me in the eyes. He sounded both
dismissive and exasperated. “Hey, maybe I didn’t even need to do
all this, take on such a big risk and all.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_299">
<p>What he was saying made it sound almost like this absurd
series of events was all a result of him taking precautions. Being
wary of something. Step by step, Housen drew closer to me.
The one who stepped in and tried to stop him was the
person from his class. Nanase.
“Please stop. Don’t do anything else. I just can’t… I can’t
accept your way of doing things, after all,” said Nanase.
She got between us, spreading her arms out wide, stopping
Housen in his tracks.
“Move, Nanase. You’re supposed be standin’ watch to make
sure no one runs away. So go stand watch,” said Housen.
“I thought that if it were for the sake of our class, I could
lend you my support until the end, Housen-kun. No matter how
terrible your strategies were, I was convinced of that. But it seems
I was wrong.”
Even though Nanase was standing in front of Housen and
barring his path, she directed her gaze squarely at Horikita.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_300">
<img src="https://cote12.ct.ws/17.jpg">
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_301">
<p>“It was impossible for you to work something out with
Housen-kun all along, Horikita-senpai. You got the idea of forming
a partnership after Housen-kun came to your floor and said
something about your class. But…that was nothing more than a
ruse, all along. Even if you did pay them a ridiculous sum of
points, like the five million he’s asking for, you would still have
suffered the same fate,” said Nanase.
After hearing this shocking truth from Nanase, Horikita
couldn’t help but feel even more shaken and upset. No matter how
hard she pressed Housen to negotiate, no matter how much effort
she put into it, he was never going to actually listen to her. And
this wasn’t Horikita’s fault at all. There was no one on our side who
could have predicted things would turn out this way.
This inexplicable series of events was probably the result of
an unequal distribution of information. There was information that
was given to Housen and Nanase, but not given to us. Under such
circumstances, there had never been a way for us to have any real
negotiations.
“Damn, all your yappin’ is really pissing me off. You’re the
one who said you’d let me handle everything in the first place,
remember? If I take out Ayanokouji, our class is gonna get tons of
cash. It’s obvious how much of an advantage that’ll give us,” said
Housen.
“Yes, I suppose you’re right. But I still cannot figure out why
it’s only Ayanokouji-senpai who needs to be targeted like this,” said
Nanase.
“That ain’t any of my concern. If you’re gonna get in my way,
then you can just piss off too!” shouted Housen. His huge form
barreled down on Nanase and slapped her out of the way just like
he’d done to Horikita before.
As I stood there by myself, watching this spectacle, I came to
one single conclusion. And with that, everything made sense.
“Here I come, Ayanokouji!”
Held in Housen’s right hand was, quite clearly, a dangerous
weapon. Naturally, everyone assumed he had meant to use it</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_302">
<p>against me. Housen, smiling, raised the knife. I pitched forward,
readying myself, while at the same time feeling my thoughts
becoming clearer.
“Ayanokouji-kun…!”
While everyone else thought I should obviously run from
Housen in a situation like this, I was, instead, rushing toward him.
I bet they were all thinking the same thing in that moment—that I
had lost my mind. After all, facing off with someone holding a knife
wasn’t exactly the mark of a sane person. And Housen wasn’t
some weak, two-bit opponent, either. He was already formidable to
begin with.
But seeing this, Housen’s smile widened. He probably
thought I was an idiot for leaping toward him. But I wasn’t actually
trying to stop him from stabbing me by rushing at him like this.
Housen, sensing that I was getting in close, accelerated the
downward arc of his arm. What he was swinging the knife at—
what he was aiming the blade at—wasn’t my body.
Housen Kazuomi was aiming for himself.
As he was mid-swing, I used my left hand to stop the knife
from reaching its intended destination. I didn’t do so by grabbing
his arm. Nor did I try to get out of the way. Instead, I thrust my
palm forward.
“Wha—?!” shouted Housen in surprise.
What I’d just done was something he clearly hadn’t
expected. Well, I supposed it would’ve been nearly impossible for
him to predict my actions. No one would assume I’d purposefully
let myself be stabbed.
The arm Housen had swung down came to a complete stop,
and the smile on his face vanished in an instant.
“You… Ayanokouji!!” he snarled.
He was baffled, naturally. Anyone would have been perplexed
by my decision to deliberately allow myself to be stabbed. My
actions must have seemed desperate and reckless.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_303">
<p>Fresh blood spurted from where the knife had impaled my
palm.
“That knife. Or to be more accurate, that petty knife. It’s the
one I purchased,” I told Housen.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_304">
<img src="https://cote12.ct.ws/18.jpg">
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_305">
<p>“What are you on about…?”
“You were going to stab yourself in the leg using that knife. A
knife that belongs to me. Afterward, all you had to do was make a
fuss about being stabbed, and then you’d have me expelled, using
your wound as physical evidence. That was your plan, wasn’t it?” I
asked him.
Judging from the way Housen had held the knife as he
swung it, it was clear he wasn’t intending to stab someone else.
He was keeping the blade at a height that made it look like
someone else was stabbing him, and it was obvious he swung the
knife while holding the handle in reverse, so he could thrust it into
his leg with more force.
“Ha…! So, you figured all that out, but still let yourself get
stabbed, huh? You outta your mind?” replied Housen with a dry
chuckle, though he was certainly a little shaken.
“Because this was the best way to stop you completely.
Besides, you had a similar plan in mind, anyway. You came here
prepared to receive a severe injury.”
Even if you understood it to be a valid strategy, most people
couldn’t bring themselves to commit such a dangerous act of self-
harm. Which was exactly why he would’ve been able to stab
himself and claim I’d been the one to do it.
“It seems there’s some other kind of special exam going on.
One that was given to a limited number of you first-years. And
judging from your conversation with Nanase, the nature of that
exam is about getting me expelled. The idea was to somehow lure
me out to this place and force a fight to happen. You’d torment
Horikita and Sudou, then say I flew into a rage and came at you
with a knife that I happened to be carrying, just in case, and
stabbed you. Then you’d have me expelled… That’s your entire
absurd plot,” I told him.
Even if the school was supposedly being more tolerant of
fighting, going so far as using a knife wouldn’t be met simply by
suspension. It would probably lead not just to expulsion, but also
to criminal charges.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_306">
<p>“I heard you weren’t nobody to mess with. But to be real
with you, I didn’t get the feelin’ that you were all that tough, so I
didn’t think much of you. I mean, I never imagined you’d just let
yourself get stabbed like that… How’d you even know this knife
belongs to you?” said Housen.
“I’ve been doing some research of my own. As of yesterday,
I was still the only person who’d purchased a petty knife here. And
yet, you have one. Which means the answer is pretty obvious.”
It would have been simple enough for me to slip under
Housen’s swing and grab his arm. However, that wouldn’t
fundamentally solve the problem at hand. All he had to do was get
his distance from me and try to stab himself all over again. The
only way to stop him for certain was to make sure he couldn’t pull
off his strategy at all.
Housen tried to pull the knife out of my hand, but I kept his
fist locked in place with the sheer strength of my grip.
“…What the hell… are you…?” huffed Housen.
Having understood the extent of my strength, he completely
lost the composure he had just moments ago.
“Well, then, what’re you going to do now?” I asked him.
“Even though I’m the owner of this knife, you’re the one who
stabbed me. And on top of that, I know you tried to buy one
yourself ahead of time. If you can’t talk your way out of this,
you’re going to be expelled, Housen.”
My fingerprints were on the handle, but so were Housen’s.
And the fact that the knife was sticking through my palm right now
couldn’t easily be explained away. The very strategy Housen had
devised had come back to bite him.
“Wait, you saw this far ahead…?!”
After Housen had finished glaring at me, he let go of the
knife and put some distance between us. The knife remained
embedded in my palm. And now, the tables had completely
turned.
In the meantime, Horikita and Sudou slowly stood back up,
beginning to recover their strength.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_307">
<p>“A-are you all right… Ayanokouji-kun?” asked Horikita.
“Ayanokouji…” said Sudou, amazed.
“Don’t worry.”
It was understandable that my two classmates were
perplexed by everything that was happening, but that would have
to wait. It was essential for me to completely shut Housen down
right now.
“Damn, how much do you even know…? Wait, Nanase! Don’t
tell me you went and blabbed to him. Did you?” said Housen.
“I didn’t say anything,” replied Nanase.
“I first felt like there was something odd back when I was
shopping with Amasawa at Keyaki Mall,” I replied.
“Amasawa-san? Are you saying she’s involved in this…?”
asked Horikita.
“Yeah. When Housen was about to buy a knife, she stopped
him. The store clerk saw it happen. You’re the one who came up
with this absurd plan, Housen, but Amasawa was the one who
perfected it. If you stabbed yourself with a knife that you’d bought,
the school would investigate and you’d be in trouble. But if you
could somehow make sure I had bought the knife instead, there
was a good chance you could completely turn the situation
around.”
The reason Amasawa had deliberately chosen the petty knife
was because it was the only one that came with a sheath, which
likely made it the most convenient choice for Amasawa and
Housen. Of course, there were other ways to conceal an exposed
blade, but if you considered that you’d be carrying it around with
you, buying one with a sheath was the easiest and most reliable
option.
I had felt like there was something off when Amasawa had
picked out this knife, without any hesitation whatsoever, in a store
that she should have never been in before. That was the first thing
that struck me. Then, Amasawa visited my room on Friday. She
said she’d lost her hair tie, but the only reason she’d come by was</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_308">
<p>to recover the knife. It was safe to assume she’d deliberately
planted the hair tie or was simply lying about it.
Also, it was possible I’d notice the knife was missing if she
came to retrieve it too soon. So she made sure to wait until the
last possible minute, seeking the right time. She took the knife out
of my room without getting her own fingerprints on it and offered
it to Housen. If she hadn’t been able to recover the knife, they
probably would’ve postponed their plan.
“Tch. Guess workin’ with that rando was a mistake, huh?”
said Housen.
“No, not really. It was thanks to Amasawa that your plan
came together. If it were just you acting alone, everything
would’ve fallen apart,” I replied.
“Whatever. Anyway, looks like you’ve got the upper hand
here now though, Ayanokouji-senpai.”
The blood from my wound had also gotten on Housen’s
clothes. There was no way he could talk his way out of this. Even if
he took the knife back now and stabbed himself in the leg, he
wasn’t going to be able to spin this in his favor. Of course, if he did
try to do that, I’d just use my full strength to stop him.
Housen, standing across from me right now, could likely
sense this much himself. The important part was what came next.
“Horikita, Sudou, and I can keep this matter between us,” I
told him.
“What are you plottin’? You’re just gonna throw away this
valuable chance to get me thrown outta school?” said Housen.
“In exchange, I have two conditions.”
“Two?”
He probably knew the first one without me having to say it.
“You’ll agree to initiate a fair, cooperative partnership with
Horikita, between our two classes.”
“Well, ain’t like I got much of a choice, since if I say no, I’ll
get kicked out. What’s the other condition?” asked Housen.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_309">
<p>“I want you to partner with me for the upcoming special
exam.”
From the moment I’d first laid eyes on Housen, I had
thought that if I were in a position to select whatever partner I
wanted, he’d be the guy I’d pick. While I had several reasons for
thinking so, the biggest one was that he didn’t seem to care one
bit about attracting attention to his problematic behavior. If I were
in Tsukishiro’s position, I would have instructed whoever he sent
after me to avoid doing anything to stand out.
If negotiations with Horikita didn’t work out, I’d considered
reaching out to Housen privately and trying to come to terms with
him. In that sense, this chain of events was actually quite
convenient for me.
“…You serious?” asked Housen.
“You’ve only just enrolled here. There are still countless
things you haven’t done yet. If you get expelled right now, it’ll be
all over. You’ll never get to enjoy any of them. I don’t know how
things were back when you were in junior high, but all that talk
about how you’re a match for Ryuuen will end up being just that—
talk. People will say you really weren’t that big a deal. And based
on what I’ve seen from Ryuuen over the past year, you can’t even
begin to compare to him as you are now. He’s strong,” I replied,
taunting him.
“You…!”
Housen Kazuomi was an incredibly proud guy. He thought
highly of himself, considering himself a strong person. Even though
he might be physically stronger than Ryuuen, it would infuriate him
to be told Ryuuen was actually better than him.
More importantly, though, there was no way he could
stomach the idea of being outsmarted by me. If Housen, who had
a B+ in academic ability, were to deliberately score a zero on the
test, he would inevitable be expelled.
Of course, it was entirely possible he’d try and take me down
with him as revenge. While I was as certain as I possibly could be
that he wasn’t the White Room student, it was also true that I</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_310">
<p>wasn’t 100% certain. I could never fully clear him of that one
suspicion, no matter how thoroughly I investigated and examined.
However, that had changed now. Even if Housen did
deliberately cut corners on the test, the fact that I’d been stabbed
remained. If it was clear there’d been something bizarre happening
behind the scenes, not even Tsukishiro would be able to force my
expulsion right away. The school would certainly want to
investigate the matter to figure out exactly what had happened,
and why Housen got a zero on the exam. Whatever tricks
Tsukishiro tried to pull, I’d hold my ground until expulsion was no
longer a possibility.
“Hey, all right, pretty good there, Ayanokouji-senpai! Never
had an opponent that got my blood pumping like you before. You
should know, I ain’t gonna be tryin’ to just make you surrender
with brute strength anymore. I’m gonna really beat ya to death, so
I hope you’re lookin’ forward to it,” said Housen.
That slight hint of him wavering was now a thing of the past.
Housen had already changed gears and was focusing on the next
battle.
“I’ll stay here. There are still some things I should explain to
Ayanokouji-senpai,” said Nanase.
“Huh? What are you plottin’, Nanase?”
“I’ve decided it would be in the best interests of Class 1-D for
me to tell him some things. Ayanokouji-senpai and Horikita-senpai
are intensely wary of us right now. If that’s the case, don’t you
think it would be a good idea for us to make sure they’re cautious
of all of the other classes, too?” she answered.
While I didn’t understand exactly what Nanase was getting
at, Housen seemed to accept her proposal.
“Whatever, go ahead,” he replied.
And with that, he was the first to leave, heading for the
dormitory.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_311">
<p>7.3
 
IT WAS NOW just Horikita, Sudou, the first-year student
Nanase, and me. While I was sure there were a few things for us
to discuss, there was something else we needed to attend to first.
Namely calming down Horikita, who had lost her cool after seeing
the knife piercing my left hand.
“Wh-what should we do…? The…the knife, I mean, should
we…should we take it out?” she stammered. The normally cool
and collected Horikita had probably never been in a situation like
this before.
“No. I know it’s probably not great to look at, but we should
leave it alone for the time being.” If we just carelessly pulled it out,
it might result in me losing a lot more blood. “More importantly,
what about you two? Are you okay?”
“Looking at your injury, I’d say I’m practically unscathed…”
said Horikita.
“Yeah… I’m definitely okay too,” said Sudou.
He came closer, until he was standing right beside me. His
face contorted in disgust when he saw the miserable state of my
left hand.
“Dude, how can you be so calm with your hand like that?”
“Hm, dunno. I wonder.”
I just did what I normally did. Nothing special.
“But, dude, like…you are crazy good in a fight, wow…” added
Sudou.
“I just forced myself to stop the knife is all,” I replied.
“…That ain’t how it looked to me though, man,” said Sudou,
speaking his mind about what he’d thought when he saw me
charge at Housen just a little while ago.
Sudou had been in a number of violent situations in his
lifetime. I didn’t think I could fake him out, and I probably couldn’t
deceive Horikita, either.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_312">
<p>I took out my phone with my right hand and dialed the
number that would connect me with Chabashira.
“I’m going to need a little help. I’m behind the first-year
dormitory building right now. Can you hurry on over? Discreetly, of
course. Oh, and also, please bring a bath towel,” I told her.
Although Chabashira seemed a little baffled by my sudden
call, she sensed the urgency of the situation and promised to head
over right away. In the meantime, it would probably be best not to
move from this spot. It would be awkward if we tried moving
locations and another student happened to see my hand.
Even so… Nanase showed no signs whatsoever of being
upset. She was completely unfazed, remaining calm and collected
even after seeing the knife impaling my hand and the spurting
blood. She didn’t seem bothered one bit by the graphic, visually
arresting spectacle.
“So, Nanase, can you tell us what’s going on?” I asked.
“If I don’t, it seems it would only put my class at more of a
disadvantage,” she answered.
“You were aware things were going to turn out this way… Is
that correct?” said Horikita.
“That’s correct. The idea was that Housen-kun would stab
himself in the leg and have Ayanokouji-senpai expelled,” said
Nanase.
She didn’t seem to feel guilty or ashamed at all. She
explained what they had planned in the same polite tone she
usually used.
“Are you saying that the friendliness that you showed us—it
was all just part of the act?” asked Horikita.
“No, that’s not true. I really do want to join forces with you,
Horikita-senpai, and for our classes to support one another. It’s
just… The plan to target Ayanokouji-senpai was our top priority,”
said Nanase.
Which meant that the reason why Housen and Nanase were
so obsessed with our class was because I was in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_313">
<p>“Why would you do all of that? Also, unlike Ayanokouji-kun, I
don’t recall ever forgiving you for what happened tonight.
Depending on how things play out, I might consider reporting you
to the school right away.” Horikita, unable to understand why I’d
been targeted, pressed Nanase to answer.
“I think there were problems with how we did things, yes,
but trying to get Ayanokouji-senpai expelled from school itself is
not counter to the school’s wishes. Very few first-year students
know about this, but it’s possible to earn a considerable number of
points by having Ayanokouji-senpai expelled,” said Nanase.
Now, the reason why I’d been targeted by Housen finally
became clear.
“We were given a special exam. For this exam, we were told
that anyone who managed to get Ayanokouji Kiyotaka from Class
2-D expelled would be paid twenty million Private Points,”
explained Nanase.
“What are you talking about? This makes no sense. Who in
the world came up with such an incredibly stupid, outrageous
special exam?” asked Horikita.
Nanase didn’t answer that question.
“…I’ve told you what I needed to say, for now. I’m sure this
will make you far more wary of every class in my grade level, not
just us now. Won’t it, Ayanokouji-senpai?” she said instead, turning
to me.
Nanase hadn’t said much. Really, she’d only told us the bare
minimum she needed to. She and Housen obviously knew what
was going on, and needless to say, Amasawa was aware of the
second special exam, too. Given everything I’d heard, it was
reasonable to assume that some students in Class 1-B and Class 1-
C probably knew about it, too.
“How do you think we could possibly be satisfied with an
answer like that? The truth of the matter is, Ayanokouji-kun was
seriously injured, and—”
“I’m fine. Just getting an understanding of the situation is
enough. Thanks for your help, Nanase,” I told her.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_314">
<p>“I chose to cooperate with Housen-kun for the good of the
case, despite knowing how unjust this is. Because the fact remains
that if the twenty million points were to fall into the hands of
another class, it would create a significant gap between us,” said
Nanase.
Twenty million points was essentially a single ticket to Class
A. But when you considered things like this current special exam,
the more financial power you had, the more advantages you’d
gain.
“However, that is not the only reason why I lent Housen-kun
a helping hand,” said Nanase.
She spoke softly and calmly, but there was something about
the way she looked at me, like she was staring daggers at me.
“’Cause I really didn’t… I mean, because I did not think that
Ayanokouji-senpai was someone suitable for this school,” said
Nanase.
For the first time, she openly stated her intense hatred for
me. But I couldn’t really figure out why.
Not too long afterward, Nanase bowed to us and left.</p>

<p class="chapter">Chapter 8:</p>
A Deepening Mystery
 
THE FOLLOWING DAY, Monday, Nanase and Horikita held a
discussion that resulted in them successfully forming an equal,
cooperative partnership between our two classes. By Tuesday, a
total of one hundred and fifty-seven pairs had been made, and
everyone moved on from there to concentrate on the written
exam. Kouenji didn’t exactly appear willing to cooperate, but
when Nanase went to him in person and asked him to be her
partner, he agreed to her request surprisingly easily. That
surprised both Horikita and me.
My left hand was seriously injured, but I supposed I could
say it was worth it. Many students were quite surprised to see my
hand wrapped up in bandages, but with the help of both
Chabashira and Mashima-sensei, everything was kept secret. And,
thanks to that, I was able to tackle the special exam without
increasing the number of people who knew the truth.
Even though I’d had many opportunities to interact with the
first-year students over the past two weeks, in the end, I still
didn’t know who the White Room student was. Considering their
apparent lack of activity even after the special exam ended, I was
honestly starting to doubt whether this person really existed at all.
Regardless, all the people I’d come into close contact with were
possible suspects I needed to watch out for.
Normally, one would think I could exclude Housen from that
list, since his exploits from junior high had become public
knowledge. However, neither Ryuuen nor Akito were directly
acquainted with Housen. In other words, it was possible this
person was an imposter who’d contacted the real Housen and
gotten all kinds of information about his past.
Nanase hadn’t seemed like she bore me any ill will at first
glance, but the way she’d closed the distance between herself and
me, the way she acted in the karaoke room and afterward, and
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_316">
<p>the fact that her contact with me from the beginning had been
calculated were all factors that couldn’t be overlooked.
Amasawa was someone I needed to be wary of, considering
she’d tried to get me expelled by working with Housen. But when
I considered that everything that they’d done was for the purpose
of securing twenty million Private Points, it made sense. In any
case, I didn’t have a single shred of evidence linking any of them
to the White Room. It also seemed like if I presented even the
slightest weakness for someone to exploit, I’d be eaten alive. And
it seemed that was going to be the case for a while.
And then… We arrived at this day. The first of May. The day
we’d find out the results of the special exam, which would be
announced during sixth period, the final class period of the day.
“I will now announce the results of the special exam. The
results will be shown up on the blackboard, but they can also be
viewed on your tablet devices, so you can look over them in
detail,” said Chabashira.
Our tablets let us zoom in and magnify any part that we
wanted to, without having to stare at the blackboard. I could tell
Horikita’s eyes were on me. There was no doubt that this special
exam was the most difficult we’d had, in terms of how hard it was
to get a high score. It was unlikely our contest would end in a tie.
On the day of the written test, the subject Horikita chose to
compete with me in was Mathematics. I opened up the app and
went to the results page, bringing up the test results on my
tablet. Most of the students in our class didn’t really pay attention
to the other numbers, but went to check their own scores first. I,
on the other hand, didn’t bother looking at my score. Instead, I
scanned the overall state of things with our class.
As for who was getting expelled… Well, it seemed we’d
successfully managed to avoid having anyone get expelled this
time. When I brought up the list of scores in order, I saw the
lowest combined score was five hundred and seventy-nine points.
It seemed everyone had managed to make it through without a
hitch.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_317">
<p>The students had worked hard, of course. But this also
proved the school hadn’t been planning to hit us with a
tremendously difficult exam right away in April, at the start of the
new school year. The actual test questions were the sort that Ike,
Satou and other students could easily score two hundred and fifty
points or more on. In other words, the predicted scores chart that
we were shown at the start of the test period had featured
intentionally low scores.
Sighs of relief and shouts of joy could be heard one after
another from the students around me. Now, then, let’s go ahead
and check Horikita’s score, just in case.
I filtered the results to show math scores, and then set
them to display in order, with the highest scores first. Wow. I
supposed it really showed that this was the subject we’d decided
to compete in. Horikita had scored eighty-even points.
Considering that the person after her was Keisei, with eighty-four
points, I couldn’t even imagine how much effort she had put into
studying for this.
The students who came after those two were all generally
those with high academic ability rankings, close to A. But it
seemed that the eighty-point mark was a pretty significant hurdle
for everyone, in all subjects. After all, out of the possible one
hundred points, the final ten points or so worth of questions were
based on things completely outside our curriculum from the past
year. And they were difficult questions, to boot.
While our class was overjoyed with how things had turned
out, I could tell the students were gradually starting to stir. Of
course, I didn’t really need to wonder why. I felt Chabashira’s
gaze on me, and the gazes of the other students who had noticed
the truth of the matter.
That was no wonder, I supposed, after they saw my name
above Horikita’s in the test results list for math, even though she
had eighty-seven points.
“A-a perfect score… Wait, seriously?”
Even if you went and sorted the results for any subject, no
one in our class had scored ninety points or higher. There was</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_318">
<p>only one exception. Mathematics, with my score. Incidentally, I
had generally scored around seventy points, give or take, in the
other subjects. Most of the students probably couldn’t
comprehend why I had scored so highly in just one of the
subjects.
The written exam was more difficult than I had expected it
to be. Despite the risk that I would get a perfect score, I
deliberately chose not to hold back. It was inevitable that doing so
would draw my classmates’ attention, and the attention of the
school at large. But considering what Tsukishiro would be doing in
the days to come, I supposed there was no harm in showing
everyone just a glimpse of what I could do. If anything, it was
probably better for me to make the first move, so that I’d have
fewer problems to deal with later on.
Sudou, who’d normally be making a fuss together with Ike
in situations like this, looked at me, shocked but quiet.
Considering he’d seen what I’d done up to this point, and what
happened with Housen and I the other day, I supposed he would
be less surprised than other students.
Anyway, things had started to change greatly in April. I
supposed I ought to be prepared to have lots of conversations
with the students who were looking at me strangely.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_319">
<p>8.1
 
WHILE CLASS WAS IN SESSION, no one could come up to me to
talk. But after class was a different story. As soon as Chabashira
dismissed us for the day, the first person to come up to me wasn’t
Horikita, but rather someone from the Ayanokouji Group. Keisei.
“Hey, Kiyotaka, you got a minute?” he asked.
It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Keisei was the top
student in Class D, boasting high scores. Which was exactly why
he knew how difficult it was to get a hundred points. I was sure
he had several questions in mind.
“I’m sorry, but would you mind waiting until later, Yukimura-
kun? I would like to have a moment with him first,” said Horikita,
cutting in, pushing Keisei aside.
“Yeah, okay. Sorry Keisei. I’ll chat with you later,” I told him.
“O-okay,” he answered.
As I left the classroom with Horikita, I saw it wasn’t just
Haruka and Airi who had their eyes on me either. I’d attracted the
attention of many other students, too.
After a few moments of silence, Horikita confirmed that
there was no one else around and then looked at me.
“I’m not going to make any excuses. I did the best I could,
yet you got a perfect score,” she said.
“You don’t want to go for a rematch?” I asked.
“I couldn’t even understand what the final questions said.
There was no way I could even solve them at my current level of
knowledge. I honestly don’t even know when I’ll learn how to
solve those problems,” said Horikita.
“Hm, well, I guess stuff like measurement and Lebesgue
integration… Probably when you get to college, I’d say?” I replied.
I wasn’t very familiar with how things worked for ordinary
students in a regular curriculum, so I couldn’t give her a precise</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_320">
<p>answer. I mean, even if I told her that those were things I’d
learned when I was a small child, it wasn’t going to be of any use
to her.
“…Never mind. It was stupid of me to say anything,” said
Horikita.
She let out a deep, forced sigh, almost like she was giving
up on something, and then looked at me with a stony gaze.
“It’s frustrating, but I admit defeat. The two things that had
happened recently make me feel as though I can’t help but
acknowledge you. If I resist any longer, I’ll only end up feeling like
an idiot,” said Horikita.
Horikita had tried her absolute best and fought admirably
but complimenting her right now would only have the opposite
effect.
“So, about the condition that you mentioned earlier—”
“Ah, there you are, Ayanokouji.”
Horikita was probably going to talk to me about the student
council, but she was interrupted. It seemed our homeroom
teacher, Chabashira, had come looking for me.
“Do you need something?” I asked.
“Wow, that’s cold. Wouldn’t you be in quite a bit of trouble
right now if I didn’t come to help you?” said Chabashira.
“Yes, that’s true. You really helped me out there.”
“I’m heading back for today. We’ll talk again later.”
As expected, Horikita wasn’t able to say what she wanted to
in front of Chabashira, so she excused herself and left. After
Chabashira watched her go, she set her sights back on me.
“It seems I’ve interrupted your conversation, but this is
urgent. Acting Director Tsukishiro has been calling for you. Come
along,” she said.
“I see,” I replied.
That was certainly something she needed to tell me about,
even if that meant interrupting.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_321">
<p>Chabashira continued talking to me while walking slightly
ahead, not turning back to look at me. “In case you’re wondering,
according to Mashima-sensei, Acting Director Tsukishiro didn’t
exhibit any unusual behaviors during the special exam.”
“That makes sense. He only made his move before the
exam. When I was getting ready,” I told her.
During the special exam, all he’d done was wait for the
results to come out.
“Is there any possibility he might use strong-arm tactics in
the future?” asked Chabashira.
“Meaning?” I asked.
“It’s not every day you get stabbed with a knife. That’s a
pretty big deal, wouldn’t you say? Your father was making his
move, wasn’t he?”
“My hand has nothing to do with that.”
I hadn’t reported the precise details of what had happened
to Chabashira. Of course, I hadn’t told her about the issue of the
twenty million points either. Chabashira likely knew nothing about
that.
“I certainly hope so. I thought he might try to restrain you
somehow. and forcefully drag you out of this school,” replied
Chabashira.
“He would need to actually get his hands on me to do that.
That’s nothing you need to worry about,” I answered.
Trussing up a little rabbit was one thing, but you couldn’t
abscond with a full-sized human quite as easily.
“In that case, good. Because I need you to be of use to me.
The fact that you got a perfect score on the math test this time
has made it perfectly clear to me that you are quite special,” said
Chabashira.
Getting a perfect score in that exam had quite a few
downsides. And while there were only a few side effects of me
having gotten that score, this was certainly one of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_322">
<p>Shortly afterward, we arrived at the reception room. I left
Chabashira behind and stepped inside by myself.
“Thank you for going to the trouble of coming to meet me
here, Ayanokouji-kun,” said Tsukishiro.
“Going as far as using my homeroom teacher, huh? What
are you playing at with that? She probably suspects something is
up,” I replied.
I wasn’t going to reveal the fact that I’d already gotten
Chabashira over to my side, so I pretended to be puzzled by the
Acting Director having called me to his office so suddenly.
“Well, now, I can’t exactly go parading around the
classrooms as the acting director now, can I?” said Tsukishiro.
He kindly urged me to take a seat, but I chose to ignore his
prompting and remained standing. After he noticed that, he
started talking once more.
“Well, now that April has ended, have you managed to
figure out the identity of the student who was sent in after you? I
was just thinking I should make sure of that,” said Tsukishiro.
So he wanted to talk about the little game he’d proposed.
He told me that if I figured out the identity of the student from
the White Room before the end of April, he would back off.
“Unfortunately, I don’t know the identity of the person from
the White Room,” I replied.
“What a flat answer. Shouldn’t you at least list the names of
students you feel are reasonably suspicious?” said Tsukishiro.
“I won’t say anything about something I’m not certain of. At
least, not in this situation,” I answered.
“I see. So, that child has managed to conceal their presence
quite well, then.” Tsukishiro nodded, apparently impressed by
that, a look of satisfaction on his face.
“I haven’t been able to detect even the slightest telltale
signs of the White Room agent. They’ve managed to cover their
tracks quite beautifully,” I remarked.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_323">
<p>“Well, I suppose that’s because for the past few months,
they’ve engaged in a specialized curriculum to learn how to act
like a high-school student,” said Tsukishiro.
Which meant they’d been planning all this well in advance.
Well, if they hadn’t been doing that, we wouldn’t be having this
conversation at all.
“You, on the other hand, seemed to struggle quite a bit
when you first arrived at this institution. From the way you talked
to the way you behaved, the way you thought, even the way you
spent your time. You came off as rather unnatural, in many
respects,” said Tsukishiro.
He sounded like he was merely teasing me, indicating that
he had control over everything.
“That’s because the reality of being a regular high school
student had only ever been a fantasy to me,” I answered.
“At any rate, you haven’t found out their identity for now,
Ayanokouji-kun. Now that I’ve confirmed that much, this meeting
is finished. You may leave,” said Tsukishiro, indicating that this
talk was over and urging me to leave the room.
There was no sign he intended to comment on the
bandages on my left hand. I stood my ground firmly, making no
attempt to leave, and instead continued speaking to Tsukishiro.
“Acting Director Tsukishiro, is it possible that you perhaps
made a miscalculation?” I asked.
“What in the world are you talking about?”
“It’s already May now. Didn’t you want to have this matter
settled by the end of April?”
“No, no, there’s no need for me to rush. I’ve actually been
given a surprisingly long extension. Longer than you might think,”
said Tsukishiro.
“Oh, is that so? And here I was thinking you must surely
have run into some unexpected trouble or something.”
“Now, that’s a rather interesting statement. What’s your
basis for that?” he asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_324">
<p>“Well, I had the impression you were fully prepared to get
me expelled with this special exam. All that remained was for the
White Room student to get in contact with me, partner up, and
that’d be it. However, none of the new students showed any signs
of even attempting to do that.”
Of course, there was Tsubaki, who had come up to me
earlier hoping to partner up…but that hardly counted.
“Actually, I’m almost tempted to think there isn’t a White
Room agent among the first-year students at all,” I added.
“You don’t really think that, do you?” he asked.
“In any case, it just doesn’t add up.”
“Thanks to the OAA app, I knew you were having trouble
finding a partner until about the midway point of the exam
period,” said Tsukishiro. “But you’re a special person. I decided it
would be dangerous to simply send the White Room student after
you and subsequently be discovered by you. I thought it would be
wiser to go after you next time, or sometime after that.”
“Talk about taking your time.”
“That might be true.”
“Or, despite your wishes, the person from the White Room
didn’t follow orders, Acting Director Tsukishiro. If you think about
the situation that way, this whole sequence of events seems to fit
into place.”
“My word. You certainly come up with some interesting
ideas, don’t you?”
Tsukishiro, smiling and apparently amused, took a sip of tea
out of his cup. After a moment of silence, he brought the cup
away from his mouth.
“Very well. It really is quite a bother for you to question the
credibility of my words, but I’ll admit it. We really did plan to have
you expelled for sure with this special exam. However, that child
ignored those plans,” said Tsukishiro.
Though he’d denied everything at first, he immediately
changed his mind and admitted the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_325">
<p>“They are a child, after all, I suppose. If this is simply due to
them being in a rebellious phase, well, we could consider that
endearing. But if that’s not the case…let’s just say it won’t be a
laughing matter,” said Tsukishiro.
The student who had been given orders and sent into this
school hadn’t followed Tsukishiro’s instructions. If that really was
true, it certainly wouldn’t be a laughing matter at all.
“Please do be careful, Ayanokouji-kun. I wasn’t the only one
who decided to send in someone from the White Room this time.
Also, considering that the assassin has disobeyed my orders and
started acting on their own, I fear my superiors might be
considering something questionable,” said Tsukishiro.
“What, are they thinking of giving up on you? I mean, your
performance has been awful.”
“That might be true. However, the fact that I’ve been
ordered to have you expelled hasn’t changed. Even if I’m being
used as a pawn, I will continue to carry out my orders until the
very end. If I fail and am cast aside, so be it. I’ll simply move on
to my next post.”
I had thought of this White Room student and Tsukishiro as
one entity, a monolith. But now the possibility that their
relationship wasn’t quite so simple had emerged. But if what
Tsukishiro was saying is true, then what are they after? If they
worked together to get me expelled, then their chances of
successfully pulling it off would certainly go up. Or was this
perhaps a feint, meant to mislead me?
Was the White Room student running wild…? Or was he
pulling the strings from the shadows? I’d say the odds of either
being the case were about even. It was also important for me to
keep in mind just how deceitful Tsukishiro was. At the very least,
he didn’t seem hurried at all, nor did he seem shaken.
“Oh, one last thing… If that child is ignoring your father’s
wishes, then depending on how things go, it may be better for
you to choose to drop out of this school yourself. After all, the
more unshakeable your position as the magnum opus of the
White Room, the more unfathomable their jealousy and hatred for</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page_326">
<p>your position will be. I shudder to think about what that child will
do to you before they’re satisfied,” said Tsukishiro.
The warning sounded so dire I could almost interpret it to
be a joke. I turned my back to him and left the room.

<p>Postscript
 
HEY THERE, it’s 2020 now! Looks like I was able to make it
to the new year and see all of you again without incident.
It’s Kinuko… You remember, right? You didn’t forget, did
you?
…Okay! So, yeah, anyway, I’m Kinuko… Or not, actually.
Kinugasa Syougo here. Happy new year to you all.
Apparently, we also managed to release the first volume of
the second-year arc without incident! Whether you’ve been
reading since the first-year arc or you’re new to the series,
welcome, and I’m looking forward to bringing you more stories
this year as well. Also, the release of this book happens to
coincide with the release date for the second Classroom art book,
it turns out. I hope you enjoy that, too.
Starting at the end of the month, we’re going to be holding
an event to commemorate moving onto the second year of the
story, so we’re looking forward to seeing people from all over the
globe turn up at the venue! Figured I’d squeeze in some
advertising about that here and there!
Well, then, now that we’ve plunged into a memorable new
arc, we’re moving forward with more things than ever before.
Ayanokouji and the rest were still quite immature when they first
started school, but they’ve sure started to show signs of maturing,
haven’t they? With the changes they’re going through after
entering their second year, and the arrival of new students,
among other things, there’s certainly a lot to write about. So
many things, in fact, that I ended up using the maximum number
of pages allowed and had to cut a page from the postscript. Just
barely managed to make it!
Anyway, I couldn’t say too much this time because I had so
little space to work with here, but I’m sure we’ll meet again soon,
so I hope to see you back next time! Oh, and there’s more fun to
be had over at the official website!</p>
